# Hyperlane Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Generated Content

The `static` directory includes generated content.

Most of this is simply serialized content from `@hyperlane-xyz` NPM packages (see `devDependencies`). Eventually this should be part of the build process.

### Installation

```
yarn install
yarn
```

### Local Development

```
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

**Important Note:** Always ensure your build completes successfully before pushing changes. Broken builds disrupt the deployment process. Use `yarn build` locally to verify everything works as expected.

### Deployment

Vercel Github Action is used to deploy the website. The action is triggered on every push to the `main` branch.

## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to improve the documentation!

There are two types of contributions you can make:

- Fix errors or add new pages to the current documentation content.
- Fix bugs or introduce new features to the documentation website (within the Docusaurus codebase).

### Content contributions

The documentation content is written in MDX format and is located in the `docs` folder.

- MDX Files: Combine Markdown with React. Learn more in the [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react).

#### Existing content

If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved in an existing document, you can click **"Edit this page" at the bottom of the page**, which will redirect to the GitHub edit form of that document. Make your changes and submit a pull request (PR).

#### New content

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch and make your changes in your repository.
3. Submit a pull request (PR) to the Hyperlane Documentation repository.

### Configuration

- `docusaurus.config.js` - This file contains the Docusaurus configuration. Here you can manage site metadata, links in the header and footer, and theme configuration. You can visit [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/configuration) to learn more about the Docusaurus settings.
- `sidebars.js` - This specifies the sidebars for your documentation. If you are adding a new page make sure to include it in the sidebar.
