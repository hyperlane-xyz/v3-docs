# MailboxClient

Inheriting from [`MailboxClient`](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/v3/solidity/contracts/MailboxClient.sol) is a simple way to ensure your contract knows where to send or receive interchain messages to or from.

This mix-in contract maintains a pointers to the three contracts Hyperlane developers may need to interact with:

1. [`Mailbox`](../messaging/messaging-interface.mdx) (required)
2. [`IPostDispatchHook`](../hooks/interchain-gas.mdx) (optional)
3. [`IInterchainSecurityModule`](../ISM/specify-your-ISM.mdx) (optional)

`MailboxClient` exposes functions that allow subclasses to easily send messages to the `Mailbox` via the `mailbox` storage variable, and permission message delivery via the `onlyMailbox` modifier.
