# Warp Route Interface

## Interface

Hyperlane Warp Route exposes the following token interface. Warp Route tokens implement this interface, in addition to the standard `ERC20` interface.

```solidity
/// @notice An interchain extension of the ERC20 interface
interface IHypERC20 is IERC20 {
  /**
    * @notice Transfers tokens to the specified recipient on a remote chain
    * @param _destination The domain ID of the destination chain
    * @param _recipient The address of the recipient, encoded as bytes32
    * @param _amount The amount of tokens to transfer
    */
  function transferRemote(
    uint32 _destination,
    bytes32 _recipient,
    uint256 _amount
  ) external payable;
}
```

## Security considerations

The deployer of a Warp Route can optionally specify the interchain security modules (ISMs) that are used to verify interchain transfer messages.

This means that each Warp Route may have a unique security configuration. Users transferring interchain tokens should understand the trust assumptions of a Route before using it.

Similarly, Warp frontends should manually curate their warp routes to avoid supporting insecure ones. See the [Warp UI deployment docs](../../guides/deploy-warp-route-UI.mdx) details.
