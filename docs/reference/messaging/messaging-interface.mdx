# Mailbox

Hyperlane's generalized message passing (GMP) interface is implemented as a smart contract called the Mailbox. This contract encodes and decodes [message headers](#message-headers), ensures global message [uniqueness](#uniqueness), and prevents [replay attacks](#replay-protection).

## Message Headers

The Mailbox prepends message bodies with a header containing the following fields:

- `version`: The version of the Mailbox contract
- `nonce`: A unique identifier for each message sent from a given Mailbox
- `origin`: The domain of the origin chain
- `sender`: The address of the sender on the origin chain
- `destination`: The domain of the destination chain
- `recipient`: The address of the recipient on the destination chain

See the [`Message` library](../libraries/message.mdx) for more information on the message encoding.

## Uniqueness

The `nonce` is a monotonically increasing integer for each message sent from a given Mailbox. It is incremented each time a message is dispatched to serve as a separator for otherwise identical messages.

```

The `messageId` is a globally unique message identifier, returned from the `dispatch` call, computed as the `keccak256` hash of the message (with headers).

## Replay Protection

The Mailbox maintains a mapping of already delivered `messageId` values to prevent replay attacks. If a message is received with a `messageId` that has already been delivered, the message is rejected.
