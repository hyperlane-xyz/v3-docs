# Interchain gas paymaster API

&#x20;Hyperlane provides an on-chain API on the origin chain that allows message senders to pay one or more [relayers](../../operate/run-relayer.mdx "mention") to deliver a message on the destination chain.

## Interface

The interchain gas paymaster (IGP) interface exposes two functions that can be used together to quote and pay for interchain gas.

1. `quoteGasPayment` is a view function that allows users to get a quote for an amount of gas on the destination chain, denominated in the origin chain's native token.
2. `payGasFor` is a payable function that pays a relayer to deliver a specific message to the destination chain

These functions do not necessarily need to be called in the same transaction as the message dispatch.

}
```

## Refunds

Users may call `payGasFor` with `msg.value` greater than what would be returned by `quoteGasPayment`. In this case, the IGP contract should refund the difference to the `_refundAddress` provided. This allows users to not need to call `quoteGasPayment` explicitly.

For example, if you are paying for 1M gas and pass 0.1 ETH to the IGP contract, but `quoteGasPayment` quotes a payment of 0.08 ETH, the `_refundAddress` will be refunded `0.02` ETH.

Note that refunds are only made if what is paid was greater than what was quoted. Refunds are **not** made if delivery of a message on the destination chain winds up requiring less gas than what was paid for.

#### Reentrancy Risk

Note that refunding overpayment involves the IGP contract calling the `_refundAddress`, which can present a risk of [reentrancy](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/3K7ZUAKpOr1GW75J2i0VHh-what-is-a-reentracy-attack) for your application. Special care should be made by callers to ensure they are not vulnerable to reentrancy exploits.

#### Unsuccessful Refunds

If a refund is unsuccessful, the `payForGas` call will revert.
