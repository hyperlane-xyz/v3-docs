# Latencies

Validators must wait a certain number of blocks to be mined before they are considered valid and [reorg-safe](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-reorg). Without this, validators could be slashed since they may have signed a checkpoint that is no longer valid.

Refer to the following sections for block finality configuration used by the Hyperlane validators.

<Tabs groupId="environment">
<TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
<ReorgPeriodTable environment="mainnet"/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">
<ReorgPeriodTable environment="testnet"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
