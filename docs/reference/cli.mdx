# Hyperlane CLI

## Overview

The Hyperlane CLI is the official command-line tool for deploying Hyperlane contracts to new chains. It also includes utilities for interacting with deployed contracts and registries.

The published version is available [on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperlane-xyz/cli). The source is available [on Github in the monorepo](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/tree/main/typescript/cli).

## Setup

:::tip

 [Node 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or newer is required

:::

To install the CLI globally, use the `npm install -g` command. This will the `hyperlane` command available anywhere in your terminal.

```bash
# Install with NPM
npm install -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli
# Or uninstall old versions
npm uninstall -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli
```

Alternatively, for running individual commands, you can use `npx` or `dlx`:

```bash
# Run via NPM's npx command
npx @hyperlane-xyz/cli
# Or via Yarn's dlx command
yarn dlx @hyperlane-xyz/cli
```

## Usage

To view a list of the available commands and their arguments, run `hyperlane --help`.

A few common command options include:
- `--version`: Display your current installed version of the CLI
- `--registry`: Set the registry URI to use for chain metadata and contract addresses
- `--overrides`: Set an additional path for overrides to the canonical registry data
- `log`: Set the log format for the CLI (defaults to pretty)
- `verbosity`: Set the log level for the CLI (defaults to info)
- `key`: Set the key to use for signing transactions (defaults to the HYP_KEY env var)

## Registries

By default, the CLI will pull chain metadata and contract addresses from the [canonical Hyperlane Registry](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry) but will write new configs and deployments to your local filesystem. For more information see the [Registries page](/docs/reference/registries.mdx).
