# Cosmos SDK

## Overview

The [Hyperlane Cosmos](https://github.com/bcp-innovations/hyperlane-cosmos) SDK Module allows Cosmos SDK-based chains to integrate Hyperlane for cross-chain messaging. It provides a permissionless way for Cosmos chains to communicate with external ecosystems, including EVM and other ecosystems where [Hyperlane is deployed on](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/addresses/mailbox-addresses).

While Hyperlane already supports Cosmos chains via [CosmWasm](https://github.com/many-things/cw-hyperlane?tab=readme-ov-file), this module expands accessibility by enabling Cosmos SDK chains—regardless of CosmWasm support—to leverage Hyperlane’s interoperability capabilities.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Interop Solution**: Implements messaging, transport, and security modules of the Hyperlane cross-chain interoperability framework for Cosmos SDK-based chains.
- **Permissionless & Open-Source**: Anyone can deploy and configure the module to fit their needs without relying on intermediaries.
- **Built by KYVE**: Developed by the [KYVE](https://www.kyve.network/) team to extend Cosmos interoperability beyond IBC.
