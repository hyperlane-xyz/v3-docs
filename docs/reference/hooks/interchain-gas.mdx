# Interchain Gas Payment

To [deliver a message](../messaging/receive.mdx), a transaction must be included on the destination chain that calls the Mailbox `process` function with the encoded message and ISM metadata.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Origin Chain
      Sender
      M_O[(Mailbox)]
      IGP[InterchainGasPaymaster]
      Sender -- "dispatch(...)\n{value}" --> M_O
      M_O -- "postDispatch(..., gasLimit)\n{value}" --> IGP
    end

    Relayer((Relayer))

    M_O -. "indexing" .-> Relayer
    IGP -. "value" .- Relayer
```

For convenience, a [relayer](../../operate/relayer/run-relayer.mdx) watches for dispatched messages and will submit process transactions on behalf of the message sender if they receive sufficient payment on the origin chain. We refer to this as *interchain gas payment*.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Relayer((Relayer))

    subgraph Destination Chain
      M_D[(Mailbox)]
      M_D -- "handle(...)" --> Recipient
    end

    Relayer -- "process{gasLimit}(...)" --> M_D
```

Because messages can trigger arbitrary code execution, the relayer must meter the [`handle` call](../messaging/receive.mdx#handle) with a `gasLimit` to charge appropriately at message dispatch time.

$$
txCost = gasPrice * gasLimit
\\[5pt]
exchangeRate = \frac{originGasTokenPrice}{destinationGasTokenPrice}
\\[5pt]
originFee = exchangeRate * txCost
$$

## Post Dispatch

During the post-dispatch hook, the `InterchainGasPaymaster` contract will revert if payment is insufficient to cover the relayer's *anticipated* costs. The relayer will honor quotes from `dispatch` time.

### Gas Limit

When none is specified, the `gasLimit` for metering the `handle` call uses a static default of `50_000`.

:::tip
We recommend developers benchmark their [`handle` implementations](../messaging/receive.mdx#handle) in unit tests to determine a reasonable `gasLimit` to use.
:::

If you expect the `handle` function to consume more than this default, you should override the [default `gasLimit` in metadata](#metadata).

### Refunds

If the message sender pays more than the hook quotes, the contract will refund the difference. If none is specified, the refund address will default to the message sender. This allows senders to skip explicit `quoteDispatch` calls.

:::warning
Refunds can present a risk of [reentrancy](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/3K7ZUAKpOr1GW75J2i0VHh-what-is-a-reentracy-attack). Special care should be taken to ensure safety against reentrancy exploits.
:::

Refunds are only made if payment is greater than the quote. Refunds **are not** made if delivery requires less gas than what was paid. If a refund is unsuccessful, the `payForGas` call will revert. To specify a different refund address, override the [default `refundAddress` in metadata](#metadata).

### Metadata

This hook expects metadata in a **packed encoding** of `StandardHookMetadata`. See the Mailbox [dispatch overloads](../messaging/send.mdx#overriding-default-hook-metadata) for how to pass metadata overrides.

<TabItem value="sol" label="Solidity">

```solidity
struct StandardHookMetadata {
    uint16 variant;
    uint256 msgValue;
    uint256 gasLimit;
    address refundAddress;
}
```

#### Examples

```solidity
bytes memory metadata = abi.encodePacked(
  StandardHookMetadata({
    variant: 1,               // only variant supported by this hook
    msgValue: 0,              // unused by this hook
    gasLimit: 100000,         // override default gas limit
    refundAddress: msg.sender // override default refund address
  })
);
```

## Gas Oracles

The interchain gas payment requirement is calculated using oraclized gas price and exchange rates between supported origin and destination chains.

:::info
Exchange rates and gas prices are up to the relayer to decide. A spread may be charged to account for drift and operating costs.

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="sol" label="Solidity">

```solidity file=<rootDir>/node_modules/@hyperlane-xyz/core/contracts/hooks/igp/InterchainGasPaymaster.sol#L220-L240
```

**Parameters**

- `destinationDomain`: The message's destination domain

**Returns**
- `tokenExchangeRate`: The exchange rate between the origin and destination chain's gas tokens
- `gasPrice`: The gas price for the destination chain

 The `quoteGasPayment` function calculates fees for the relayer's anticipated costs.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/node_modules/@hyperlane-xyz/core/contracts/hooks/igp/InterchainGasPaymaster.sol#L194-L211
```

**Parameters**
- `destinationDomain`: The message's destination domain
- `gasLimit`: The gas limit to meter the `handle` call with

**Returns**
- `fee`: The payment required for the `postDispatch` to succeed

## Retrying

If the `handle` call consumes more gas than quoted, the relayer will not submit a process transaction. In this case, additional gas can be paid for with the `payForGas` function.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/node_modules/@hyperlane-xyz/core/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainGasPaymaster.sol#L24-L29
```

**Parameters**
- `messageId`: The message identifier returned from `dispatch` call
- `destinationDomain`: The message's destination domain
- `gasAmount`: The additional gas amount to pay for
- `refundAddress`: The address to refund excess payment to
