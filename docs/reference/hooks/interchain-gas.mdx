# Post-Dispatch Interchain Gas Payment

During the post-dispatch hook, the `InterchainGasPaymaster` contract will revert if payment is insufficient to cover the relayer's _anticipated_ costs. The gas quote calculated at `dispatch` time must align with the relayer’s anticipated costs.

## Gas Limit

The `gasLimit` is set based on the cost of calling `handle` on the destination chain for a given message. This can vary depending on message content and the logic of the handler.

The default `gasLimit` for metering the handle call is a static default of `50_000` gas. This is sufficient for simple operations but may not be enough for more complex `handle` functions.

If your handle function performs complex operations or requires more gas, you must override the [default `gasLimit` in metadata](#metadata) to avoid transaction reverts. Benchmark your [`handle` implementations](../messaging/receive.mdx#handle) in unit tests to determine a reasonable `gasLimit` to use.

### Metadata

This hook expects metadata in a **packed encoding** of `StandardHookMetadata`. See the Mailbox [dispatch overloads](../messaging/send.mdx#overriding-default-hook-metadata) for how to pass metadata overrides.

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="sol" label="Solidity">

```solidity
struct StandardHookMetadata {
    uint16 variant;
    uint256 msgValue;
    uint256 gasLimit;
    address refundAddress;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `StandardHookMetadata` struct defines the fields required for metadata encoding:

- `variant`: Specifies the metadata format version.
- `msgValue`: Amount of native token sent with the message.
- `gasLimit`: Gas limit for the `handle` function on the destination chain. Ensure this matches your simulation results.
- `refundAddress`: Address to refund unused gas payments.

To encode this metadata, use the `StandardHookMetadata.formatMetadata` library function. Direct encoding of the struct with `abi.encodePacked` is not supported in Solidity.

#### Example Usage

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="sol" label="Solidity">

```solidity
// Example: Encoding metadata using StandardHookMetadata
bytes memory metadata = StandardHookMetadata.formatMetadata(
    0,               // ETH message value
    200000,          // Custom gas limit
    address(this),   // Refund address
    bytes("")        // Optional custom metadata
);
```

### Determine and Override the Gas Limit

1. Simulate and Benchmark Gas Usage:

- Use tools like Tenderly or Foundry to simulate your transaction and measure gas consumption.
- If gas usage exceeds `50,000` gas, calculate an appropriate `gasLimit` and update your metadata.

2. Update Your Metadata:

- Calculate the required `gasLimit` based on the simulation.
- Pass the updated `gasLimit` in your metadata to ensure the relayer will deliver your message.

## Destination Gas Config

For each remote domain, the InterchainGasPaymaster sets the domain gas config.

```solidity
struct DomainGasConfig {
    IGasOracle gasOracle;
    uint96 gasOverhead;
}
```

### Gas overhead

The gas overhead is set as part of the destination gas configuration. This corresponds to the operational cost of processing a message on the destination chain.

:::info

- You should ensure the `gasOverhead` sufficiently covers the range of ISMs on your destination chain.
- As you can configure different ISMs for different message types, you may have different gas overheads for each ISM's `verify` function.

:::

## Gas Oracles

Interchain Gas Payment requirements are calculated using oraclized gas prices and exchange rates between the origin and destination chains.

IGP contracts may be configured with gas oracles, which are responsible for tracking remote token gas prices and exchange rates. This allows the `quoteGasPayment` function to provide an accurate quote for the price of gas on a remote chain, denominated in the local chain's native token.

:::info

- Exchange rates and gas prices are up to the relayer to decide. A spread may be charged to account for drift and operating costs.
  :::

Eventually, a relayer will be able to automatically update their gas oracles in order to ensure that their IGP always quotes a fair price for remote gas.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/node_modules/@hyperlane-xyz/core/contracts/hooks/igp/InterchainGasPaymaster.sol#L220-L240

**Parameters**

- `destinationDomain`: The message's destination domain

**Returns**

- `tokenExchangeRate`: The exchange rate between the origin and destination chain's gas tokens
- `gasPrice`: The gas price for the destination chain

### `quoteGasPayment`

The `quoteGasPayment` function calculates fees for the relayer's anticipated costs.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/node_modules/@hyperlane-xyz/core/contracts/hooks/igp/InterchainGasPaymaster.sol#L194-L211

```

**Parameters**

- `destinationDomain`: The message's destination domain
- `gasLimit`: The gas limit to meter the `handle` call with

**Returns**

- `fee`: The payment required for the `postDispatch` to succeed

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Retrying

If the `handle` call consumes more gas than quoted, the relayer will not submit a process transaction. This issue often occurs due to insufficient gas payment during the initial `dispatch`.

In this case, additional gas can be paid for with the `payForGas` function.

<TabItem value="sol" label="Solidity">

```solidity file=<rootDir>/node_modules/@hyperlane-xyz/core/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainGasPaymaster.sol#L24-L29

```

**Parameters**

- `messageId`: The message identifier returned from `dispatch` call
- `destinationDomain`: The message's destination domain
- `gasAmount`: The additional gas amount to pay for
- `refundAddress`: The address to refund excess payment to

## Using the Hyperlane Explorer for Debugging

The Hyperlane Explorer is a powerful tool to debug cross-chain message issues, including gas payments and relayer behavior.

### Key Features

- **Message Status**: View the current status of your message (e.g., "Retry: GasPaymentRequirementNotMet").
- **Gas Payment Details**: Check the gas amount paid (Origin IGP gas amount) and the amount required by the relayer.
- **Simulate Calldata**: Use the "View calldata details" option to simulate transactions on tools like Tenderly.

## Troubleshooting

This section covers common issues developers encounter with Interchain Gas Payments, along with potential solutions.

### `GasPaymentRequirementNotMet` Warning

- **Reason:** This occurs when the gas payment provided during `dispatch` does not meet the relayer's calculated requirement.

- **Solution:**
  - Use `quoteGasPayment` to calculate the required payment for the destination domain and gas limit.
  - Verify that `msg.value` in your metadata covers the relayer’s quoted fee.
  - Check the message status in the Hyperlane Explorer. Look for: `Retry(GasPaymentRequirementNotMet)`.

### High Testnet Gas Prices

- **Reason:** Some testnets have limited gas token liquidity, which results in inflated gas prices.

- **Solution:**
  - Simulate the transaction to estimate realistic gas costs.
  - Be aware that testnet relayers may charge higher fees due to low token availability.
  - Consider testing on a different network with lower gas token prices, if possible.

### Fallback Routing and Overpayment Warning

- **Reason:** `msg.value` exceeds the required gas payment, triggering the fallback routing hook.

- **Solution:**
  - Verify that your quoting logic (`quoteDispatch`) matches the relayer's anticipated fees.
  - Avoid overestimating `gasLimit` values without first benchmarking the `handle` function.
  - Simulate the transaction to confirm appropriate payment.

### Unexpectedly Large Gas Quotes

- **Reason:** A very high `gasLimit` was set, leading to excessively large gas quotes.

- **Solution:**

  - Double-check the `gasLimit` specified in your metadata.
  - Use `quoteGasPayment` to calculate the required fee the `gasLimit`.
  - Adjust the `gasLimit` to match the estimated gas consumption of your `handle` function.
