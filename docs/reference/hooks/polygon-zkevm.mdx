#  PolygonZkevm ISM and hook
Polygon Zkevm have their own bridging interface to transfer assets and messages across the parent and child chain -  [zkEVM Bridge](https://docs.polygon.technology/zkEVM/architecture/protocol/zkevm-bridge/). Message ID is passed via this interface to verify the integrity of the message sent across chain using hyperlane messenger.

To provide this security option in Hyperlane we created the hook and ISM combo that can be transparently configured to use the zkEVM bridge.

See the [addresses](../contract-addresses.mdx) page for Hook and ISM addresses. 

## How It Works

here's the flow for how the system works (this applies to `L1 <-> L2` and `L2<->L1`) : 

the ism verifies if the message has been sent by the hook

    subgraph Origin Ethereum
      Sender
      M_O[(Mailbox)]
      Hook[PolygonZkEvmHook]
      Eth[(zkEVM Bridge)]

      Sender -- "dispatch(...)" --> M_O
      M_O -- "postDispatch(message)" --> Hook
      Hook -- "sendMessage(messageId)" --> Eth
    end

    M_O -. "relay" .-> M_D
    Eth -. "Rollup sync" .-> Polygon

    subgraph Destination Polygon zkEvm chain
      Recipient
      M_D[(Mailbox)]
      ISM{PolygonZkEvmISM}
      Polygon[(zkEVM Bridge)]

      M_D -- "verify(..., message)" --> ISM
      M_D -- "handle(...)" --> Recipient
      ISM -. "interchainSecurityModule()" .- Recipient

      Polygon -- "verifyMessageId(messageId)" --> ISM
    end
