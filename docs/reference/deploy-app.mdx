# Hyperlane Deploy App

## Overview

The [Hyperlane Deploy App](https://deploy.hyperlane.xyz) is a simpler but less flexible alternative to the [Hyperlane CLI](/docs/reference/cli.mdx). It currently supports the deployment of new Warp Routes using a basic, default configuration for the route's ISM and Hooks.

## Warp Deployments

### Configuring a Warp Route

For each chain you'd like to connect your route to, the app will need to the token 'type' and, if applicable, the collateralized token address.

The type refers to what kind of token contract will be deployed. If you intend to bridge a native asset, like ETH on Ethereum, then select the 'native' type. If you intend to bridge an ERC20 token, like USDC, then select the 'collateral' type. Typically, a route has one chain with a collateral or native type and then one or more chains with synthetic types. The synthetic types mean their assets on that chain will be minted as assets as locked into the collateral/native type. Routes with more than one collateralized type are called 'multi-collateral' routes. These routes are more complex to manage as the locked assets must be kept in balance across the route's chains.

Here's an example of a simple route for USDC on Sepolia. The USDC token's address has been inputted into the collateral field: `0xf08A50178dfcDe18524640EA6618a1f965821715`

### Reviewing the deployment

The next step will display a summary of the route's configuration, including metadata for for route's tokens. Some fields, such as the name and/or symbol of the synthetic tokens, can be modified at this step. 

The contract owner will be set to the connected wallet's address. If a different account should own the newly deployed contracts, that can also be changed here.

### Executing the deployment

To begin the deployment, some gas fees will be required for each chain in the route. The app will automatically create a temporary deployer wallet. Use the 'Fund' button to transfer gas fees to the deployer accounts. Once each account is funded, the deployment will automatically begin.

Finally, once the deployment is complete, the app will offer for you to copy the new Warp Route config for use in other places like the Warp UI or the CLI. A history deployments can be seen by clicking the clock icon above the form.
