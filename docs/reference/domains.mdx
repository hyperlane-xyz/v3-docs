# Domain Identifiers

## Core Domains

This list includes only the deployments on chains that are managed by Abacus Works (our legal entity). Anybody can deploy Hyperlane on any chain [permissionlessly](../deploy-hyperlane.mdx) - we are building a registry to reflect the community's permissionless deployments.

Hyperlane uses unique IDs for each Hyperlane-supported chain. When possible Hyperlane domain IDs match EVM chain IDs, but this is not guaranteed as we support non-EVM chains as well.

When [sending a message](../your-first-message.mdx), users must provide the domain ID of the destination chain. When [receiving a message](./messaging/receive.mdx), the recipient will be passed the domain ID of the origin chain.
