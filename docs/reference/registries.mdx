# Hyperlane Registries

## Overview

Hyperlane can be deployed anywhere by anyone. But for those deployments to be useful, their details must be well known. Registries are collections of chain metadata, contract addresses, and other useful information for interacting with Hyperlane contracts and tools. There is a [canonical registry](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry) maintained by the Hyperlane core team. The [CLI](/docs/reference/cli.mdx), the [Explorer](https://explorer.hyperlane.xyz), and other tools can use registry data.

## Canonical registry

Metadata and artifacts for deployments done by the Hyperlane core team will be available here:
https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry

However, community members are encouraged to add their own deployments to this canonical registry. The steps to contribute are as follows:

1. Fork and clone the registry repository
2. Use the CLI and set the `--registry` flag to the local path of the cloned repository
3. Execute your commands as needed
4. Push your changes to your fork and create a pull request

## Custom registries

As long as the registry conforms to the same layout and file schemas as the canonical registry, any Github repository URL or local file path can be used instead.

The CLI has two command line arguments for configuring the registry it uses:

- The `--registry` flag sets the primary registry and uses the default Github registry if not set
- The `--overrides` flag sets an optional additional path which can be useful for forcing specific overrides of the default data, for example to use a different RPC URL in a chain's metadata.

Once your custom registry additions/updates are complete and tested, consider opening a pull request to the canonical registry so that others can benefit from your deployments.

For more information see the [CLI reference page](/docs/reference/cli.mdx).

## Usage (Javascript & Typescript)

### Install

```bash
# With npm
npm install @hyperlane-xyz/registry
# Or with yarn
yarn add @hyperlane-xyz/registry
```

### Get Content

#### Via the package (static)

The simplest way to access the registry data would be to import the desired parts directly from the package:

```ts
// Via the base package
import { ethereum, ethereumAddresses } from "@hyperlane-xyz/registry";
// Or via sub-exports for more optimal bundles if your bundler allows it
import { metadata, addresses } from "@hyperlane-xyz/registry/chains/ethereum";
```

#### Via the utilities (dynamic)

If you need to ensure you have the latest data, registry content can be fetched on-the-fly with the `GithubRegistry` class.

```ts
import { GithubRegistry } from "@hyperlane-xyz/registry";
const registry = new GithubRegistry();
const chainMetadata = await registry.getMetadata();
```
