# Intro to Hyperlane

## What is Hyperlane?

Hyperlane is a permissionless interoperability protocol for cross-chain communication across different blockchain environments. It enables message passing and asset transfers across different chains without relying on centralized intermediaries or requiring any permissions.

Hyperlane's permissionless design means that anyone can [deploy hyperlane](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/deploy-hyperlane) to any blockchain environment, whether it is a layer 1, rollup, or app-chain, and start building cross-chain applications right awayâ€”no approvals, no intermediaries. This gives developers full control over how their dApp operates in a multi-chain environment, removing bottlenecks and enabling scalability.

Designed with modularity in mind, Hyperlane's [Interchain Security Modules (ISM)](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/protocol/ISM/modular-security) allow developers to configure, compose, and customize their security model according to their application's needs.

## Start Building with Hyperlane

Get started with Hyperlane by exploring deployment guides & key features:

- **[Bridge a token with Hyperlane Warp Routes](/guides/deploy-warp-route.mdx)**: Warp Routes enable seamless cross-chain transfers for native and `ERC20` tokens.
- **[Learn about General Message Passing](./reference/messaging/send.mdx)**: Send arbitrary messages between chains.
- **Use [Interchain Accounts](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/applications/interchain-account)**: Execute smart contract calls on remote chains from a single account.
- **[Deploy Hyperlane to your chain](/deploy-hyperlane.mdx)**: Set up Hyperlane on a new chain.
