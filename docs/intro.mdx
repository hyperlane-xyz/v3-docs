# Choosing Hyperlane

Hyperlane is the first universal and permissionless interoperability layer built for the modular blockchain stack.

Anyone can permissionlessly [deploy hyperlane](./deploy-hyperlane.mdx) to any blockchain environment, whether it is a layer 1, rollup, or app-chain, allowing that chain to communicate seamlessly with any other chain on which Hyperlane has been deployed.

Hyperlane is designed with modularity in mind. Notably, its [interchain security modules](./protocol/ISM/modular-security.mdx) give developers control over their security model, allowing them to configure, compose, and customize security according to the needs of their application.

Using Hyperlane, developers can build Interchain Applications - apps that span multiple blockchains. We have implementations for many execution environments and are compatible with all leading rollup frameworks.

Some pre-built examples that can be deployed out of the box include:

1. Warp Routes, which allow native and `ERC20` tokens to move seamlessly across chains
2. Interchain accounts, which allows an account on one chain (e.g. a DAO) to make smart contract calls on remote chains
3. Interchain queries, which allow an account on one chain to make view calls on remote chains
