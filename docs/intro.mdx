# Intro to Hyperlane

## What is Hyperlane?

Hyperlane is a permissionless interoperability protocol for cross-chain communication. It enables message passing and asset transfers across different chains without relying on centralized intermediaries or requiring any permissions.

## Why Hyperlane?

Hyperlane's permissionless design means that anyone can [deploy hyperlane](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/deploy-hyperlane) to any blockchain environment, whether it is a layer 1, rollup, or app-chain, and start building cross-chain applications right awayâ€”no approvals, no intermediaries. This gives developers full control over how their dApp operates in a multi-chain environment, removing bottlenecks and enabling scalability.

Designed with modularity in mind, Hyperlane's [Interchain Security Modules (ISM)](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/protocol/ISM/modular-security) allow developers to configure, compose, and customize their security model according to their application's needs.

## Start Building with Hyperlane

Some pre-built examples that can be deployed out of the box include:

1. [Warp Routes](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/protocol/warp-routes/warp-routes-overview), which allow native and `ERC20` tokens to move seamlessly across chains
2. [Interchain accounts](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/applications/interchain-account), which allow an account on one chain (e.g. a DAO) to make smart contract calls on remote chains
3. Interchain queries, which allow an account on one chain to make view calls on remote chains
