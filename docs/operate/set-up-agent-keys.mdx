# Agent keys

Hyperlane agents - Validators and the Relayer - must be configured with private keys in order to operate. Validators use private keys to sign [message checkpoints](../reference/glossary.mdx#checkpoint), and the Relayer uses private keys to sign transactions that deliver messages.

Hyperlane agents currently support being configured with private keys in one of two ways.

## 1. Hexadecimal keys

A raw hexadecimal private key used for in-memory signing. This is the easiest and fastest setup for testing.

:::warning

Hexadecimal keys are **not** recommended for production environments. Use AWS KMS keys instead.

:::

### Generate a hexadecimal key

Keep track of your address and private key for use with your agent. Do not lose or leak it.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cast" label="Cast CLI">
Using [Foundry's cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/), you can create a new key pair:

```sh
cast wallet new
```

The output will look something like this:

```
Successfully created new keypair.
Address: 0x32e6d32E7b1C8691Ef4ad3841003371214a0eebC
Private Key: 0x2958f0eb2ab71bbfb5ea1422835e20e488778b61e3c107f369572e2b53b578f9
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="privatekeys" label="Using privatekeys.pw">
You can visit [https://privatekeys.pw/keys/ethereum/random](https://privatekeys.pw/keys/ethereum/random), which will automatically display a list of hexadecimal private keys and their addresses.

:::warning

Please note that because these are generated by a website, these private keys should be considered insecure and should not be used for anything other than testing purposes!

## 2. AWS KMS

A key generated by AWS and stored in a CloudHSM. This is the recommended setup for production agents, **especially** for Validators.

### Create an IAM user

This IAM user will be given permission to sign with the KMS key that you will later configure. Your Hyperlane agent will use this identity when signing transactions.

1. Go to AWS's Identity and Access Management (IAM) in the [AWS console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home).
2. On the left, under "Access management", click "Users".
3. Click the blue button "Add users".
4. Pick a friendly and informative username, like `hyperlane-validator-${chain_name}` or `hyperlane-relayer-${chain_name}`. This username will be referenced in future steps, so if you choose a different username be sure to use your correct username in the future.
5. Click "Next", you do not need to assign the user any permissions.
6. Click "Create user".
7. Click into the user that you just created
8. Click the "Security Credentials" tab
9. Scroll down to "Access Keys" and click "Create Access Key"
10. Select "Application running outside AWS" and click "Next"
11. Click "Next", no need to add a description tag&#x20;
12. Click "Create access key"
13. Copy the "Access key ID" and "Secret access key" to a safe place. These will be passed to your Hyperlane Relayer as environment variables.

### Create a KMS key

This key will be used by your agent for signing.

1. Go to AWS's Key Management Service (KMS) in the AWS console.
2. Ensure you are in the region you want to create the key in. This can be confirmed by viewing the region at the top right of the console, or by finding the name in the URL's subdomain (e.g. `us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com` means you're operating in the region `us-west-2`).
3. On the left, click "Customer managed keys".
4. Click "Create key".
5. Select the "Asymmetric" key type.
6. Select the "Sign and verify" key usage.
7. Select the `ECC_SECG_P256K1` key spec.
8. Click "Next".
9. Set the Alias to something friendly and informative, like `hyperlane-validator-signer-${chain_name}` or `hyperlane-relayer-signer-${chain_name}`
10. While not necessary, feel free to write a description and add any tags that you think will be useful.
11. Click "Next".
12. A key administrator is not required, but if you want, you can select one.
13. Click "Next".
14. Give usage permissions to the IAM user you created in section #1.
15. Click "Next".
16. In the Review page, scroll to the "Key policy". The generated key policy is acceptable, but you can make the access even less permissive if you wish by:
    1. Removing the `kms:DescribeKey` and `kms:Verify` actions from the statement whose "Sid" is "Allow use of the key"
    2. Removing the entire statement whose "Sid" is "Allow attachment of persistent resources".
17. Click "Finish"

:::tip

Advanced users may consider using the [IAM/KMS terraform module](deploy-with-terraform.mdx#iam--kms) instead to create the IAM user and KMS key.

### Query address

In some cases you may need to know the address associated with the KMS key you generated.

<TabItem value="cast" label="With `cast`">

```
