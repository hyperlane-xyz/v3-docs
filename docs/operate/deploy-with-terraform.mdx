# Deploy with Terraform

For those more familiar with deploying to AWS through infrastructure-as-code tools such as Terraform, we provide an example configuration designed to set up the necessary infrastructure for a Hyperlane Validator on AWS. It automates the creation of resources such as ECS clusters, VPCs, subnets, and security groups required for running a Validator agent.

[**Click here to navigate to the example Terraform configuration.**](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/tree/main/rust/terraform)

:::warning

The configuration provided is intended to only be an _example_ of running a Validator for a core supported network. You may have to modify the Validator module to support more advanced configurations. It is recommended to test thoroughly before using this setup in a production environment.

:::

## Overview

The provided terraform has a few key parts:

- IAM/KMS module: automatically completes [Agent Keys](set-up-agent-keys.mdx) configuration for you.
- S3 module: automatically completes [AWS Signatures Bucket](validators/validator-signatures-aws.mdx) configuration for you.
- EFS module: sets up a persistent volume that can be mounted to the Validator.
- Validator module: uses the above modules to run an instance of a Validator.
- `global.tf`: top-level networking configuration for a cluster that Validators can run in.
- `main.tf`: configures Validators for deployment.

The diagram below shows how it fits together.

    subgraph VPC_Network ["VPC Network"]
        Subnet -- Protected by --> SG[AWS Security Group]

        subgraph SG ["AWS Security Group"]
            NATG[AWS NAT Gateway]
            IGW[AWS Internet Gateway]
        end
    end

    subgraph ECS_Validator ["Validator Module"]
        ECSTask[ECS Task: Validator] -- Executes in --> Subnet
    end

    subgraph S3_Subgraph ["S3 Module"]
        S3Bucket[AWS S3 Bucket] -- Accessed by --> ECSTask
        ECSTask -- Writes to --> S3Bucket[Validator Signatures]
    end

    subgraph EFS_Subgraph ["EFS Module"]
        EFS[AWS EFS] -- Mounted on --> ECSTask
    end

    subgraph IAM_KMS ["IAM / KMS Module"]
        IAMUser[Validator IAM User]
        KMSKey[KMS Key]
    end

    Internet -- Accessing Metrics --> IGW
    NATG -- RPC Calls --> Internet

    %% Additional Interconnections
    ECSTask -- Signs with --> KMSKey
    ECSTask -- Perms from --> IAMUser

```

## Usage

As a prerequisite, you need to have Terraform installed and the AWS CLI configured with your credentials.

To initialize the terraform state:

```bash
terraform init
```

To generate the plan of infrastructure changes:

```bash
terraform plan
```

To preview and apply the infrastructure changes:

```bash
terraform apply
```

To list the outputs such as KMS, IAM or S3 information, you will have to parse the JSON output:

```bash
terraform output -json
```

## Modules

Several modules exist so you can choose which parts of the Validator setup you would like managed by terraform.

### IAM / KMS

The `iam_kms` module creates an IAM user and a KMS key for secure signing operations. It also sets up IAM policies and attachments to grant the necessary permissions for using the KMS key and other AWS services, such as S3, EFS and ECS later on.

### S3

The `s3` module creates an S3 bucket for storing Validator-related data, such as signatures. It also sets bucket policies to manage access and permissions, including public access restrictions and versioning.

### EFS

The `efs` module defines an EFS file system and access point, allowing the Validator application to store and access data on EFS. It also sets up a mount target for connecting the EFS file system to the network.

:::note
This module is only required when using the `validator` module.
:::

### Validator

The `validator` module uses all of the above to integrate the EFS, IAM/KMS, and S3 configurations.

In addition to:
- Creating a new IAM user and relevant roles to run a Validator.
- Creating an S3 bucket that a Validator can write signatures to.
- Creating an EFS volume to persist data in the service.

This module also:
- Defines an ECS task definition for running the Validator application, including container definitions, volume configurations, and logging.
- Creates an ECS service to manage the deployment and scaling of the Validator tasks.

## Main Configuration

The root level configuration sets up a VPC, subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateway, route tables, and security groups for network infrastructure. It also provides example usage of the `validator` module.

```terraform
module "your_validator_name" {
  source = "./modules/validator"

  validator_name    = "your-validator-name"
  origin_chain_name = "originChainName"

  aws_region               = var.aws_region
  validator_cluster_id     = aws_ecs_cluster.validator_cluster.id
  validator_subnet_id      = aws_subnet.validator_subnet.id
  validator_sg_id          = aws_security_group.validator_sg.id
  validator_nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.validator_nat_gateway.id

  # Disabling the Validator task allows you to set up all the required infrastructure
  # without running the actual Validator yet. This is useful when setting up a Validator for
  # the first time, so that you can find out the Validator's address and fund it before it
  # performs the announcement transaction.
  # validator_task_disabled = true
}
```

### Outputs

The root-level `outputs.tf` passes forward all outputs from the Validators configured in `main.tf`. **You will have to update this as you add, modify or remove Validators.**

### Example architecture

The diagram below shows how the Validator ECS cluster fits into the top-level network infrastructure.

```mermaid

    subgraph VPC_Network ["VPC Network"]
        VPC[AWS VPC]
        Public_Subnet[AWS Public Subnet]
        Private_Subnet[AWS Private Subnet]
        VPC -- Connected to --> IGW[AWS Internet Gateway]
        VPC -- Contains --> SG[AWS Security Group]
        Public_Subnet -- Internet Access via --> IGW
        Private_Subnet -- Internet Access via NAT --> NAT_Gateway[AWS NAT Gateway]
        NAT_Gateway -- Utilizes --> EIP[AWS Elastic IP]
        NAT_Gateway -- Located in --> Public_Subnet

        subgraph Routing ["Routing"]
            Public_Subnet -- Associates --> Public_Route_Table[AWS Public Route Table]
            Public_Route_Table -- Routes Internet Traffic --> IGW
            Private_Subnet -- Associates --> Private_Route_Table[AWS Private Route Table]
            Private_Route_Table -- Routes Traffic To --> NAT_Gateway
        end
    end

    subgraph ECS_Infrastructure ["ECS Infrastructure"]
        VPC -- Hosts --> ECS_Cluster[AWS ECS Cluster]
        SG -- Secures --> ECS_Cluster
    end

## Known issues

### PI configuration

It is non-trivial to set custom configuration values for PI chains, such as ones you've deployed Hyperlane to yourself.
Currently you may have to just pass a long list of environment variables or command line arguments.

### Individual agent logs

Currently all agents log to the same log group - `DefaultLogGroup`. To separate them per agent, you may have to adjust the log group name and update the agent's log policy with the new group name.

### Relayer module

The docker image supports running both types of agents. Therefore, if you choose to do so, you can use the Validator module as a starting point for a new Relayer module.
