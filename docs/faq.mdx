# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

**What is Hyperlane?**  
Hyperlane is the first universal and permissionless interoperability framework built for the modular blockchain stack. Anyone can [Deploy Hyperlane](./deploy-hyperlane.mdx) to any blockchain environment, whether it is a layer 1, rollup, or app-chain, allowing that chain to communicate seamlessly with any other chain on which Hyperlane has been deployed.

**What are the benefits of using Hyperlane for blockchain developers?**  
Hyperlane offers benefits for both blockchain and dapp developers.

- For blockchain developers, a Hyperlane deployment expands accessibility to users, assets, and valuable state from other connected blockchains on which Hyperlane has been deployed.
- For dapp developers, Hyperlane provides seamless connectivity across multiple blockchains, allowing developers to create interchain network effects and liquidity and users to interact with applications from their preferred chain.

**What is Abacus Works?**  
Abacus Works is the name of a legal identity working on Hyperlane. You may encounter some references to Abacus in older posts and repositories. Hyperlane rebranded from Abacus to Hyperlane in Fall 2022.

**What can I build with Hyperlane?**  
Hyperlane's [Messaging interface](./reference/messaging/messaging-interface.mdx) allows dapp developers to send arbitrary bytes between smart contracts on different chains. This can be used to create interchain applications, dapps which span multiple chains.

For inspiration, take a look at some of the pre-built applications built on top of Hyperlane, including:

- **Warp Routes**: Lets users move tokens from one chain to another.
- **Interchain Accounts**: Lets users make interchain function calls.
- **Interchain Queries**: Lets users make interchain view calls.

**I’m a developer. How can my team build with Hyperlane?**  
If you’re reading this FAQ, you’ve found the docs which is a great place to start. That said, we know that questions arise during implementation, and we’re happy to help you on your way. The Hyperlane community is regularly active in the [Discord](http://discord.gg/hyperlane). Feedback from developers directly influences the product roadmap.

## Technical Questions

**How is Hyperlane secured?**  
Hyperlane is secured by its modular security stack featuring Interchain Security Modules (ISMs). Developers can configure various pre-built ISMs, compose them with each other, or even create custom ISMs based on their application's needs.

A modular approach to security ensures that Hyperlane will continue to stay up to the latest industry advances in security models.

**Who are the Hyperlane validators?**  
Hyperlane is secured with a modular security stack featuring ISMs. There is no protocol-enshrined security model, let alone validator set. That said, most Hyperlane deployments are configured with a Default ISM, which specifies the security model to use if the message recipient has not specified an ISM override.

**Where is Hyperlane deployed?**  
A list of known deployments can be found on the [contract addresses](./reference/addresses/mailbox-addresses.mdx) page.

**What happens when I send a message on Hyperlane?**  
See the [send](./reference/messaging/send.mdx) and [receive](./reference/messaging/receive.mdx) pages for more details. In summary:

1. An application calls the `dispatch()` function on the origin chain, inserting the message into the Mailbox's Merkle tree.
2. A Hyperlane Relayer observes the dispatched messages and assembles metadata for the recipient's Interchain Security Module (ISM).
3. A relayer delivers the message to the recipient by calling `Mailbox.process()`.
4. The Mailbox verifies the message with the recipient’s ISM and calls `recipient.handle()` to deliver the message.

**How can I see the status of a message I have sent?**  
Paste an address or transaction hash into the search bar of the [Hyperlane Message Explorer](https://explorer.hyperlane.xyz/) to view details about a message’s status and history.

If the message has failed to send for some reason, there will be error messages indicating what may have gone wrong. See [Explorer Debugging](/docs/guides/explorer/explorer-debugging.mdx) for more information.

**Does sending interchain messages with Hyperlane mean live chat & text?**  
No, Hyperlane is a protocol designed to allow smart contracts on different chains to interact with each other.  
When we refer to message-passing, it’s the sending of arbitrary bytes between smart contracts rather than peer-to-peer or text messaging.

For chat use cases, consider [XMTP](https://xmtp.org/), [Push](https://push.org/), or [Orbis](https://useorbis.com/).

**Is Hyperlane a token bridge?**  
Not exactly. Hyperlane is a general message passing (GMP) protocol that allows communication between blockchains. Token bridges are just one of many types of applications that can be built on top of Hyperlane!
