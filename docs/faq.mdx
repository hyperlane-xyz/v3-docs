# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

**What is Hyperlane?**  
Hyperlane is the first universal and permissionless interoperability framework built for the modular blockchain stack. Anyone can [deploy Hyperlane](./deploy-hyperlane.mdx) to any blockchain environment, whether it is a layer 1, rollup, or app-chain, allowing that chain to communicate seamlessly with any other chain on which Hyperlane has been deployed.

**What are the benefits of using Hyperlane for blockchain developers?**  
Hyperlane offers benefits for both blockchain and dapp developers.

- For blockchain developers, a Hyperlane deployment expands accessibility to users, assets, and valuable state from other connected blockchains on which Hyperlane has been deployed.
- For dapp developers, Hyperlane provides seamless connectivity across multiple blockchains, allowing developers to create interchain network effects and liquidity and users to interact with applications from their preferred chain.

**What is Abacus Works?**  
Abacus Works is the name of a legal identity working on Hyperlane. You may encounter some references to Abacus in older posts and repositories. Hyperlane rebranded from Abacus to Hyperlane in Fall 2022.

**What can I build with Hyperlane?**  
Hyperlane's [messaging interface](./protocol/mailbox.mdx) allows dapp developers to send arbitrary bytes between smart contracts on different chains. This can be used to create interchain applications, dapps which span multiple chains.

For inspiration, take a look at some of the pre-built applications built on top of Hyperlane, including:

- **Warp Routes**: Lets users move tokens from one chain to another.
- **Interchain Accounts**: Lets users make interchain function calls.
- **Interchain Queries**: Lets users make interchain view calls.

**I’m a developer. How can my team build with Hyperlane?**  
If you’re reading this FAQ, you’ve found the docs which is a great place to start. That said, we know that questions arise during implementation, and we’re happy to help you on your way. The Hyperlane community is regularly active in the [Discord](http://discord.gg/hyperlane). Feedback from developers directly influences the product roadmap.

## Technical Questions

### Messaging

**What happens when I send a message on Hyperlane?**  
See the [send](./reference/messaging/send.mdx) and [receive](./reference/messaging/receive.mdx) pages for more details. In summary:

1. An application calls the `dispatch()` function on the origin chain, inserting the message into the Mailbox's Merkle tree.
2. A Hyperlane Relayer observes the dispatched messages and assembles metadata for the recipient's Interchain Security Module (ISM).
3. A relayer delivers the message to the recipient by calling `Mailbox.process()`.
4. The Mailbox verifies the message with the recipient’s ISM and calls `recipient.handle()` to deliver the message.

**How can I see the status of a message I have sent?**  
Paste an address or transaction hash into the search bar of the [Hyperlane Message Explorer](https://explorer.hyperlane.xyz/) to view details about a message’s status and history.

If the message has failed to send for some reason, there will be error messages indicating what may have gone wrong. See [Explorer Debugging](/docs/guides/explorer/explorer-debugging.mdx) for more information.

**Does sending interchain messages with Hyperlane mean live chat & text?**  
No, Hyperlane is a protocol designed to allow smart contracts on different chains to interact with each other.  
When we refer to message-passing, it’s the sending of arbitrary bytes between smart contracts rather than peer-to-peer or text messaging.

For chat use cases, consider [XMTP](https://xmtp.org/), [Push](https://push.org/), or [Orbis](https://useorbis.com/).

**Is Hyperlane a token bridge?**  
Not exactly. Hyperlane is a general message passing (GMP) protocol that allows communication between blockchains. Token bridges are just one of many types of applications that can be built on top of Hyperlane!

### Deployment

**Where is Hyperlane deployed?**  
A list of known deployments can be found on the [contract addresses](./reference/addresses/mailbox-addresses.mdx) page.

### Advanced Topics

**How is Hyperlane secured?**  
Hyperlane is secured by its modular security stack featuring Interchain Security Modules (ISMs). Developers can configure various pre-built ISMs, compose them with each other, or even create custom ISMs based on their application's needs.
A modular approach to security ensures that Hyperlane will continue to stay up to the latest industry advances in security models.

**How many validators does Hyperlane have, and who operates them?**  
The number of validators depend on the Interchain Security Module (ISM) configuration. The Default ISM uses a specific validator set, and you can view the details such as threshold, operator and address [here](./reference/default-ism-validators).

**How can we ensure message integrity?**  
Hyperlane's message security is driven by the Interchain Security Module (ISM) configuration. By default, messages rely on the Default ISM's validator set, which requires a quorum of validators to sign for security. In the unlikely event of a validator compromise, the security of messages could be impacted. However, developers have the flexibility to configure their own ISM, enabling them to customize and strengthen the security model to suit their application's needs.

**Does the source chain receive confirmation whether the transaction was executed on the destination chain?**  
Currently, the source chain does not automatically receive a confirmation of execution from the destination chain. However, this functionality can be added by customizing the `handle` function on the destination chain. For more information, refer to the [handle function](./reference/messaging/receive#handle).

**Why are outbound message IDs stored in the Merkle tree?**  
Outbound message IDs are stored in the Merkle tree to efficiently track and verify messages. This mechanism ensures validators can accurately detect and sign new messages as they are created.

**Why do validators call `MerkleTreeHook.latestCheckpoint()`?**  
Validators use the [`MerkleTreeHook.latestCheckpoint()`](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/5e9b8ba7ab0f54e92b3cf32806fae95eb23ad0f8/solidity/contracts/hooks/MerkleTreeHook.sol#L49) function to determine when new transactions need to be indexed. This polling mechanism ensures validators can immediately start signing new messages without the need to backfill the entire tree.
