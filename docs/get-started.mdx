# Get Started

Hyperlane can be deployed by anyone to any chain. 
This guide covers sending your first interchain message from a new EVM chain.

## Overview
There are five steps in this guide:
1. [<b>Set up keys</b>](#1-set-up-keys) that you will use to deploy contracts and run validators and relayers
2. [<b>Deploy contracts</b>](#2-deploy-contracts) to the local chain and to every remote chain with which the local chain will be able to send and receive messages.
3. [<b>Run validators</b>](#3-run-validators) on your local chain, to provide the signatures needed for the sovereign consensus you deployed in step 2.
4. [<b>Run relayer</b>](#4-run-relayer) to send and receive messages between chains you deployed contracts to in step 2.
5. [<b>Send a test message</b>](#5-send-test-messages) to confirm that your relayer is able to deliver messages from and to each pair of chains


## Getting Started

## 1. Set up keys

There are three keys to set up and fund. To get started, you can simplify by using the same hexadecimal key for all three roles.

<table><thead><tr><th>Key Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Funding Needs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Contract Deployer</td><td>32 byte hexadecimal private key</td><td>Funded on all the chains on which we need to deploy contracts.</td></tr><tr><td>Validator Accounts</td><td>A list of validator addresses to configure a Multisig ISM, or just one to get started quickly</td><td>A small amount to do announce the location of the validator signatures</td></tr><tr><td>Relayer Accounts</td><td>The relayer client(s) use one account on the local chain and an additional account for each of the remote chains</td><td>Each relayer instance must be configured with a key that has a balance on all the other chains.</td></tr></tbody></table>

For instructions on how to generate keys, see the agent keys <!-- [](../operators/agent-keys/ "mention") --> section. Your deployer key **must** be a hexadecimal key, while validator and relayer keys can be hexadecimal or AWS KMS.

If deploying on a local network using [Foundry's Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/anvil), use the following command to fund your newly-generated account. It uses one of the pre-funded private keys to transfer 1 ETH to the address in the `$YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` variable.

```
cast send $YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY \
--private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
--value $(cast tw 1)
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Do not proceed to the next section until you have set up deployer, validator, and relayer keys.**
{% endhint %}

## 2. Deploy contracts

### Overview

In this step we will be deploying Hyperlane smart contracts to the local and remote chains.

On the local chain, we will deploy:

* The core contracts, including a [messaging.md](../protocol/messaging.md "mention") that can be used to send and receive messages

On all chains, we will deploy:

* A [multisig-ism.md](../protocol/sovereign-consensus/multisig-ism.md "mention") that can be used to verify inbound messages
* A [#interchaingaspaymasters](../protocol/interchain-gas-payments.md#interchaingaspaymasters "mention"), which can be used to pay our relayer for delivering interchain messages
* A `TestRecipient`, which we will send messages to, in order to test that everything is working correctly

### Setup

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have not yet set up your deployer, validator, and relayer keys, see [#1.-setup-keys](get-started.mdx#1.-setup-keys "mention")
{% endhint %}

First, set up the `hyperlane-deploy` repo. This repo contain scripts to deploy Hyperlane contracts. You will need to install [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) if you haven't already.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-deploy.git
cd hyperlane-deploy
yarn install
```

Next, add a [`ChainMetadata`](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/typescript/sdk/src/consts/chainMetadata.ts#L21) entry for your local chain to `hyperlane-deploy/config/chains.ts`. An example has been populated for you for [`anvil`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/).&#x20;

Any chains that already have Hyperlane deployments do not need to be configured here (see [chainMetadata.ts](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/typescript/sdk/src/consts/chainMetadata.ts) for a list of chains for which metadata has already been provided).

```typescript
export const chains: ChainMap<ChainMetadata> = {
  // ----------- Your chains here -----------------
  anvil: {
    name: 'anvil',
    // anvil default chain id
    chainId: 31337,
    publicRpcUrls: [
      {
        http: 'http://localhost:8545',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Finally, add the `MultisigIsmConfig` entry for your local chain to `hyperlane-deploy/config/multisig_ism.ts`. An example with a single validator has been populated for you for `anvil`.&#x20;

Any chains that already have Hyperlane deployments do not need to be configured here (see [multisigIsm.ts](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/typescript/sdk/src/consts/multisigIsm.ts) for a list of chains for which ISM configs have already been provided).

```typescript
export const multisigIsmConfig: ChainMap<MultisigIsmConfig> = {
  // ----------- Your chains here -----------------
  anvil: {
    threshold: 1,
    validators: [
      // Last anvil address
      '0xa0ee7a142d267c1f36714e4a8f75612f20a79720',
    ],
  },
};
```

### Deploy

You can then run `yarn ts-node scripts/deploy-hyperlane.ts` to deploy the Hyperlane contracts. You will need to provide the following arguments:

* `local`: The local chain on which Hyperlane is being deployed
* `remotes`: The chains with which 'local' will be able to send and receive messages
* `key`: A hexadecimal private key for transaction signing

An example deployment command to `anvil` that supports communication with `goerli` and `sepolia` is shown below:

```bash
DEBUG=hyperlane* yarn ts-node scripts/deploy-hyperlane.ts --local anvil \
  --remotes goerli sepolia \
  --key 0x6f0311f4a0722954c46050bb9f088c4890999e16b64ad02784d24b5fd6d09061
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The deploy script will only accept chains for which configuration has been provided. If you do not see your desired chain in the list of choices, you may be missing config in `chains.ts` or `multisig_ism.ts`
{% endhint %}

### Verify

If everything ran successfully, congrats! You should see contract addresses written to `artifacts/addresses.json`, and agent config written to `artifacts/agent_config.json`

```bash
$ head -n 19 artifacts/addresses.json
{
  "anvil": {
    "validatorAnnounce": "0x177B784C94d85f6645a35BfD14175D44045e573f",
    "proxyAdmin": "0x5Dfb392D946d0F3b6af599705541050A6ca6A870",
    "mailbox": "0x74756B469390CAee600F332184895ACbf86C4396",
    "multisigIsm": "0x1dD5a3E037be5C46839192a5b83a260166751409",
    "testRecipient": "0x7672E92386B49717D32946214A10B1988542F660",

    "interchainGasPaymaster": "0x9368C1f2B6BE2869018622a9aB43a5D8ED27Fba2",
    "defaultIsmInterchainGasPaymaster": "0xc1FD390F3aB9d0e2bb8394B0DeCE48D31fC44121"
  },

$  head -n 22 artifacts/agent_config.json
{
  "chains": {
    "anvil": {
      "name": "anvil",
      "domain": 31337,
      "addresses": {
        "mailbox": "0x74756B469390CAee600F332184895ACbf86C4396",
        "interchainGasPaymaster": "0x9368C1f2B6BE2869018622a9aB43a5D8ED27Fba2",
        "validatorAnnounce": "0x177B784C94d85f6645a35BfD14175D44045e573f"
      },
      "signer": null,
      "protocol": "ethereum",
      "finalityBlocks": 1,
      "connection": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": ""
      },
      "index": {
        "from": 17
      }
    }
  },
```

## 3. Run validators

Follow the [validators](../operators/validators/ "mention") guide to run validators for the [messaging.md](../protocol/messaging.md "mention")on your local chain. These validators will provide the security for messages sent **from** your chain **to** remote chains.

Include the agent config from the [#2.-deploy-contracts](get-started.mdx#2.-deploy-contracts "mention") step in `CONFIG_FILES`. If you're using Docker, you will need to mount the file into the container.

You should have already set up your validator keys in step [#1.-setup-keys](get-started.mdx#1.-setup-keys "mention"), so you can skip that part of the [validators](../operators/validators/ "mention") guide.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure these validators match the addresses you provided when in your `MultisigIsmConfig`. Otherwise, the [multisig-ism.md](../protocol/sovereign-consensus/multisig-ism.md "mention")s you deployed in the previous step will not be able to verify messages sent from your chain.
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="../operators/validators/" %}
[validators](../operators/validators/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## 4. Run relayer

Follow the [relayers](../operators/relayers/ "mention") guide to run a relayer that will deliver interchain messages sent between the local and remote chains.

Remember to set `--relayChains` or `HYP_BASE_RELAYCHAINS` appropriately.

Include the agent config from the [#2.-deploy-contracts](get-started.mdx#2.-deploy-contracts "mention") step in `CONFIG_FILES`. If you're using Docker, you will need to mount the file into the container.

You should have already set up your relayer keys in step [#1.-setup-keys](get-started.mdx#1.-setup-keys "mention"), so you can skip that part of the [relayers](../operators/relayers/ "mention") guide.

{% content-ref url="../operators/relayers/" %}
[relayers](../operators/relayers/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## 5. Send test messages

You can check everything is working correctly by sending a test message between each pair of chains.

You can run `yarn ts-node scripts/test-messages.ts` to send test messages. You will need to provide the following arguments:

* `chains`: Test messages will be sent between each pair of these chains
* `key`: A hexadecimal private key for transaction signing

An example command that tests that messages can be sent between any pair of `anvil`, `goerli`, and `sepolia` is shown below:

```bash
DEBUG=hyperlane* yarn ts-node scripts/test-messages.ts \
  --chains anvil goerli sepolia \
  --key 0x6f0311f4a0722954c46050bb9f088c4890999e16b64ad02784d24b5fd6d09061
```



If everything ran successfully, congrats! You should something similar to the following output:

```bash
$ yarn ts-node scripts/test-messages.ts --chains anvil goerli --key 0x6f0311f4a0722954c46050bb9f088c4890999e16b64ad02784d24b5fd6d09060

```

If you've waited a while and messages still aren't being delivered, take a look at the origin chain relayer logs and reach out on [discord](https://discord.gg/hyperlane).

## Header

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest hyperlane-v3-docs classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd dev/hyperlane-v3-docs
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.mdx` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
