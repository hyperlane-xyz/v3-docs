# How to Productionize Your Hyperlane Warp Route Deployment

In order to productionize your Hyperlane warp route deployment, you must [remove the trusted relayer ISM](/guides/remove-trusted-relayer.mdx)
from your warp route. In addition, you will need to [transfer ownership](/guides/transfer-warp-route-ownership.mdx) of your warp route. After doing so, add your warp route to [the Registry](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry/tree/main/deployments/warp_routes) for review and inclusion in the network and its integrations.

Please continue to the following guides to bring your warp route to production.
