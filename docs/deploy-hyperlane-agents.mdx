# Get Started

Hyperlane can be deployed by anyone to any chain.
This guide covers sending your first interchain message from a new EVM chain. By the end of this guide you will have deployed and configured your mailbox and Hyperlane Messaging (./), allowing developers to send interchain messages to and from your chain.

## Overview

There are five steps in this guide:

1. [<b>Set up keys</b>](#1-set-up-keys) that you will use to deploy contracts and run validators and relayers
2. [<b>Deploy contracts</b>](#2-deploy-contracts) to the local chain and to every remote chain with which the local chain will be able to send and receive messages.
3. [<b>Run validators</b>](#3-run-validators) on your local chain, to provide the signatures needed for the interchain Security Modules you deployed in step 2.
4. [<b>Run relayer</b>](#4-run-relayer) to send and receive messages between chains you deployed contracts to in step 2.
5. [<b>Send a test message</b>](#5-send-test-messages) to confirm that your relayer is able to deliver messages from and to each pair of chains

## Getting Started

## 1. Set up keys

There are three keys you must set up and fund. To get started, you can simplify by using the same hexadecimal key for all three roles.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Funding Needs</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Contract Deployer</td>
      <td>32 byte hexadecimal private key</td>
      <td>Funded on all the chains on which we need to deploy contracts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Validator Accounts</td>
      <td>
        A list of validator addresses to configure a Multisig ISM, or just one
        to get started quickly
      </td>
      <td>
        A small amount to do announce the location of the validator signatures
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Relayer Accounts</td>
      <td>
        The relayer client(s) use one account on the local chain and an
        additional account for each of the remote chains
      </td>
      <td>
        Each relayer instance must be configured with a key that has a balance
        on all the other chains.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For instructions on how to generate keys, see the [agent keys](./operate/set-up-agent-keys.mdx) section. Your deployer key **must** be a hexadecimal key, while validator and relayer keys can be hexadecimal or AWS KMS.

If deploying on a local network using [Foundry's Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/anvil), use the following command to fund your newly-generated account. It uses one of the pre-funded private keys to transfer 1 ETH to the address in the `$YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` variable.

```
cast send $YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY \
--private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
--value $(cast tw 1)
```

## 2. Deploy contracts

Once you have set up deployer, validator, and relayer keys it's time to use the Hyperlane CLI to deploy smart contracts to the local and remote chains.

On the local chain, we will deploy:

- The core contracts, including a Mailbox, that can be used to send and receive messages

On all chains, we will deploy:

- A Multisig ISM that can be used to verify inbound messages
- An `InterchainGasPaymaster`, which can be used to pay our relayer for delivering interchain messages
- A `TestRecipient`, which we will send messages to, in order to test that everything is working correctly

### Setup

First, install the [Hyperlane CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperlane-xyz/cli) from NPM. [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or newer is required. The following command will install it globally on your machine. See the [package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperlane-xyz/cli) for alternatives such as temporary install or building from source.

```bash
npm install -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli
```

Next, determine what custom chain configs you will need for your local and remote chains. Any chains that are already included in the Hyperlane SDK won't need a chain config (but can optionally have one if you want to override default settings).
Run the following to see the default SDK chains:

```bash
hyperlane chains list
```

For any chains that need custom configs, you can define them manually using JSON or YAML (see [example config](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/typescript/cli/examples/chain-config.yaml)), or create them with the following command:

```bash
hyperlane config create chain
```

Now the CLI will know how to interact with all your chains, but it will also need to know how to configure your Interchain Security Module (ISM).

:::info

Note, currently only Multisig-based ISMs are supported by the CLI. More complex ISMs will require manual deployments.

:::

To create a multisig ISM configs, you can define it manually using JSON or YAML (see [example config here](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/v3/typescript/cli/examples/multisig-ism.yaml)), or create it with the following command:

```bash
hyperlane config create multisig
```

When asked about the multisig type, choose `message id ism`. In the context of this guide, we will be using a 1/1 multisig, so choose a threshold of `1` and enter the address of your key.

### Deploy

We're now ready to use the `deploy core` command to deploy the Hyperlane contracts. To pay for transactions, the command will need the contract deployer key from step 1, which can be provided via the `HYP_KEY` env variable or as a command argument.

```bash
hyperlane deploy core \
    --targets chain1,chain2,... \ # all the chains you want to bridge between
    --chains $CHAIN_CONFIG_FILE \  # chain configuration
    --artifacts $PREDEPLOYED_ARTIFACT_FILE \ # in case, you already have predeployed some of the contracts and want to reuse them
    --ism $MULTISIG_CONFIG_FILE \ #
    --out $OUT_DIR \
    --key $YOUR_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Verify

Deployment contract artifacts will be written to to the `artifacts/` folder by default. The deployer will create two timestamped files, `agent-config-{timestamp}.json` and `core-deployment-{timestamp}.json`
The `core-deployment` file contains the addresses of core contracts, organized by chain.
The `agent-config` file contains the data needed to run Hyperlane agents for the next step.

## 3. Run validators

Follow the [Validators](./operate/validators/run-validators.mdx) guide to run validators for the Mailbox on your local chain. These validators will provide the security for messages sent _from_ your chain to remote chains.

Include the agent config from the [deploy contracts](#2-deploy-contracts) step in `CONFIG_FILES`. If you are using Docker, you will need to mount the file into the container.

You should have already set up your validator keys in [step 1](#1-set-up-keys), so you can skip that part of the [Validators](./operate/validators/run-validators.mdx) guide.

:::info

Make sure these validators match the addresses you provided when in your MultisigIsmConfig. Otherwise, the Multisig ISM you deployed in the previous step will not be able to verify messages sent from your chain.

:::

## 4. Run relayers

Follow the [Relayer](./operate/relayer/run-relayer.mdx) guide to run a relayer that will deliver interchain messages sent between the local and remote chains.

Remember to set `--relayChains` or `HYP_RELAYCHAINS` appropriately.

Include the agent config from the [deploy contracts](#2-deploy-contracts) step in `CONFIG_FILES`. If you are using Docker, you will need to mount the file into the container.
You should have already set up your relayer keys in [step 1](#1-set-up-keys), so you can skip that part of the [Relayer](./operate/relayer/run-relayer.mdx) guide.

## 5. Send test messages

You can check everything is working correctly by sending a test message between each pair of chains.
Use the Hyperlane CLI again to send the message:

```
hyperlane send message \
   --origin YOUR_ORIGIN
   --destination YOUR_DEST
   --core PATH_TO_STEP2_ARTIFACTS
```

The `send message` command will inform you when the message is dispatched. After a short wait, a confirmation of delivery will be displayed. If the message delivery times out, it is likely that there's an issue with the Validator or Relayer setup in steps 3 and 4 above.
To troubleshoot start by looking at the relayer logs. If you need further help, reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperlane).
