Once messages are being delivered, you can optionally deploy a [Warp Route](/docs/reference/applications/warp-routes). Warp is toolkit for permissionlessly bridging tokens between any chains. The routes can use native currencies (like `Eth`), or ERC20 tokens (like `USDC`).

To begin, create a new route config.

```bash
hyperlane config create warp
```

Next, you can deploy the route. As before, the CLI will prompt for a core deployment artifacts file.

```bash
hyperlane deploy warp --key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

Once finished, the CLI will create two new JSON artifact files: `warp-deployment-{timestamp}.json` and `warp-ui-token-config-{timestamp}`. The first only contains the addresses of the newly deployed Warp router contracts. The second is a config file for the Warp UI, which you can use for the next optional step.

Follow the detailed [**Deploy Warp Guide**](/docs/guides/deploy-warp-route) to learn more about the underlying concepts and how to set up your Warp Route to transfer tokens.

### Deploy the Warp UI

The Warp UI is a DApp template for interacting with Warp Routes. You can clone the [Warp UI repo](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-warp-ui-template) and follow the instructions in CUSTOMIZE.md to configure and create a new instance. In short, use the `chains.yaml` and `warp-ui-token-config.json` files from the previous steps to provide the UI with the information it needs. See the [**Deploy Warp UI guide**](/docs/guides/deploy-warp-route-UI) for step-by-step instructions.
