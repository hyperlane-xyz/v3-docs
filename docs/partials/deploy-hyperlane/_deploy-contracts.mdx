Once you have set up deployer, validator, and relayer keys it's time to use the Hyperlane CLI to deploy smart contracts to the local and remote chains.

On the local chain, we will deploy:

- The core contracts, including a [Mailbox](/docs/reference/messaging/messaging-interface) that can be used to send and receive messages.

On all chains, we will deploy:

- A Multisig ISM that can be used to verify inbound messages from the other local & remote chains.
- An `InterchainGasPaymaster`, which can be used to pay our relayer for delivering interchain messages.
- A `TestRecipient`, which we will send messages to, in order to test that everything is working correctly.

### Setup

First, install the [Hyperlane CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperlane-xyz/cli) from NPM. [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or newer is required. The following command will install it globally on your machine. See the [package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperlane-xyz/cli) for alternatives such as temporary install or building from source.

```bash
npm install -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli
```

Next, determine what custom chain configs you will need for your local and remote chains. Any chains that are already included in the Hyperlane SDK won't need a chain config (but can optionally have one if you want to override default settings).
Run the following to see the default SDK chains:

```bash
hyperlane chains list
```

You can press space to select your chains. For any chains that need custom configs, you can define them manually using JSON or YAML (see [example config](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/typescript/cli/examples/chain-config.yaml)), or create them with the following command:

```bash
hyperlane config create chain
```

Now the CLI will know how to interact with all your chains, but it will also need to know how to configure your Interchain Security Module (ISM).


To create a multisig ISM configs, you can define it manually using JSON or YAML (see [example config here](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/v3/typescript/cli/examples/multisig-ism.yaml)), or create it with the following command:

```bash
hyperlane config create ism
```

When asked about the multisig type, choose `message id ism`. In the context of this guide, we will be using a 1/1 multisig, so choose a threshold of `1` and enter the address of your key.

### Dry Run

Prior to executing a deployment, you can execute a dry-run via `--dry-run`, `-dr`, or `-d` to ensure that the deployment will be successful as well as provide analytics on the gas costs of deployment.
This will not deploy any contracts, but you will be able to see all the contracts that will be deployed, along with the generated artifacts at `$OUT_DIR/dry-run_*`.

In addition to validating your upcoming deployment, you can provide the address of the EOA you intend to deploy with via `--key` or `-k`.
This will ensure you have approximately enough funds to complete the deployment, without providing access to your private key to pay for transactions.
Additionally, gas usage statistics will be displayed in your console to provide insight into the cost of deployment.

:::note

In order to execute a dry-run, you will need an Anvil node running in a separate terminal instance.
To spin up an Anvil node, run `anvil`.
For more on Anvil and installation, checkout [Foundry's Anvil docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/).

:::

```bash
hyperlane deploy core --dry-run \
    --targets chain1,... \ # one of the chains you want to bridge between
    --chains $CHAIN_CONFIG_FILE \  # path to chains.yaml config e.g. ./configs/chains.yaml
    --ism $MULTISIG_CONFIG_FILE \ # path to ism.yaml config e.g. ./configs/ism.yaml
    --artifacts $PREDEPLOYED_ARTIFACT_FILE \ # (optional) in case you want to reuse contracts you've already predeployed
    --out $OUT_DIR \ # (optional) deployment contract artifacts; defaults to /artifacts
    --key $YOUR_DEPLOYER_ADDRESS # (optional) your account address to be impersonated via Anvil; can also be provided via HYP_KEY env variable
```

### Deploy

We're now ready to use the `deploy core` command to deploy the Hyperlane contracts. To pay for transactions, the command will need the contract deployer key from step 1, which can be provided via the `HYP_KEY` env variable or as a command argument.

```bash
hyperlane deploy core \
    --targets chain1,chain2,... \ # all the chains you want to bridge between
    --chains $CHAIN_CONFIG_FILE \  # path to chains.yaml config e.g. ./configs/chains.yaml
    --ism $MULTISIG_CONFIG_FILE \ # path to ism.yaml config e.g. ./configs/ism.yaml
    --artifacts $PREDEPLOYED_ARTIFACT_FILE \ # (optional) in case you want to reuse contracts you've already predeployed
    --out $OUT_DIR \ # (optional) deployment contract artifacts; defaults to /artifacts
    --key $YOUR_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY # (optional) your private key to pay for transactions; can also be provided via HYP_KEY env variable
```

### Verify

Deployment contract artifacts will be written to to the `artifacts/` folder by default. The deployer will create two timestamped files, `agent-config-{timestamp}.json` and `core-deployment-{timestamp}.json`
The `core-deployment` file contains the addresses of core contracts, organized by chain.
The `agent-config` file contains the data needed to run Hyperlane agents for the next step.
