Once you have set up deployer, validator, and relayer keys it's time to use the Hyperlane CLI to deploy smart contracts to the local and remote chains.

On the local chain, we will deploy:

- The core contracts, including a [Mailbox](/docs/reference/messaging/messaging-interface) that can be used to send and receive messages.

On all chains, we will deploy:

- A Multisig ISM that can be used to verify inbound messages from the other local & remote chains.
- An `InterchainGasPaymaster`, which can be used to pay our relayer for delivering interchain messages.
- A `TestRecipient`, which we will send messages to, in order to test that everything is working correctly.

### Setup

First, install the [Hyperlane CLI](/docs/reference/cli.mdx).

```bash
npm install -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli
```

#### Chains

<CliChainsPartial />

#### ISM

Now the CLI will know how to interact with all your chains, but it will also need to know how to configure your Interchain Security Module (ISM).

To create a multisig ISM configs, you can define it manually using JSON or YAML (see [example config here](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/v3/typescript/cli/examples/multisig-ism.yaml)), or create it with the following command:

```bash
hyperlane config create ism
```

When asked about the multisig type, choose `message id ism`. In the context of this guide, we will be using a 1/1 multisig, so choose a threshold of `1` and enter the address of your key.

### Dry Run a Core Deployment

Prior to executing a deployment, you can perform a dry-run via `--dry-run <CHAIN_NAME>`  or `-d <CHAIN_NAME>` to ensure that the deployment will be successful as well as provide analytics on the gas costs of deployment. This will not trigger any real transactions but will simulate a deployment to display a list of required contracts and their respective gas costs.

In addition to validating your upcoming deployment, you can optionally provide the address of the EOA you intend to deploy with via `--from-address` or `-f`.
This will ensure you have approximately enough funds to complete the deployment.

:::note

In order to execute a dry-run, you will need an Anvil node running in a separate terminal instance.
To spin up an Anvil node, run `anvil`.
For more on Anvil and installation, checkout [Foundry's Anvil docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/).

:::

```bash
hyperlane deploy core --dry-run chain1 \
    --ism $MULTISIG_CONFIG_FILE \ # path to ism.yaml config e.g. ./configs/ism.yaml
    --from-address $YOUR_DEPLOYER_ADDRESS \ # (optional) your account address to be impersonated via Anvil; defaults to the HYP_KEY env variable
    --registry \ # (optional) path to your primary registry; defaults to the Hyperlane github registry
    --overrides # (optional) path to a override registry; defaults to the local ./ path
```

### Deploy

We're now ready to use the `deploy core` command to deploy the Hyperlane contracts. To pay for transactions, the command will need the contract deployer key from step 1, which can be provided via the `HYP_KEY` env variable or as a command argument.

```bash
hyperlane deploy core \
    --targets chain1,chain2,... \ # all the chains you want to bridge between
    --ism $MULTISIG_CONFIG_FILE \ # path to ism.yaml config e.g. ./configs/ism.yaml
    --key $YOUR_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY \ # (optional) your private key to pay for transactions; can also be provided via HYP_KEY env variable
    --registry \ # (optional) path to your primary registry; defaults to the Hyperlane github registry
    --overrides # (optional) path to a override registry; defaults to the local ./ path
```

### Verify

Deployment contract artifacts will be written to the configured registries. By default, you'll find the new addresses in the local directory you ran the command from (e.g. `./chains/chain1/addresses.yaml`).

The deployment will also generate a Hyperlane Agent config, which is written to `./configs/agent.json` by default, but can be configured with the `--agent` flag.
