You can check everything is working correctly by sending a test message between pairs of chains.
Initiate the message with the CLI. It will ask for a set of core deployment artifacts to use. Select the `core-deployments` JSON file from Step 2.

```bash
hyperlane send message --key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

The `send message` command will inform you when the message is dispatched. After a short wait, a confirmation of delivery will be displayed. If the message delivery times out, it is likely that there's an issue with the Validator or Relayer setup in the steps above. To troubleshoot start by looking at the origin chain relayer logs.
