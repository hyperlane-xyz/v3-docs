There are three keys you must set up and fund.

:::tip

To get started, you can simplify by using the same hexadecimal key for all three roles.

:::

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key Role</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Funding Needs</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Contract Deployer</td>
      <td>32 byte hexadecimal private key</td>
      <td>Funded on all the chains on which we need to deploy contracts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Validator Accounts</td>
      <td>
        A list of validator addresses that will sign outbound messages from your
        local chain. Just one validator works to get started quickly.
      </td>
      <td>
        A small amount so validators can announce the location of their
        signatures onchain with a one-time transaction
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Relayer Accounts</td>
      <td>
        The single relayer you will operate requires an account on each chain it
        will deliver messages to & from
      </td>
      <td>
        The relayer must have a balance on all chains it's relaying between.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For instructions on how to generate keys, see the [agent keys](/docs/operate/set-up-agent-keys) section. Your deployer key **must** be a hexadecimal key, while validator and relayer keys can be hexadecimal or AWS KMS.

If deploying on a local network using [Foundry's Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/anvil), use the following command to fund your newly-generated account. It uses one of the pre-funded private keys to transfer 1 ETH to the address in the `$YOUR_TARGET_ADDRESS` environment variable.

```
cast send $YOUR_TARGET_ADDRESS \
--private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
--value $(cast tw 1)
```
