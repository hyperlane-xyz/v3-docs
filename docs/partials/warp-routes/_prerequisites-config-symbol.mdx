## Prerequisites

- The warp route config.
    - For new deployments, this config may take the filepath of `CURRENT_DIR/configs/warp-route-deployment.yaml`.
    - For existing deployment, the config can be generated by using `hyperlane warp read` if it exists in the Registry.
- The warp route token symbol.
    - The token symbol can be found onchain, or in your local Hyperlane Registry. By default, it is written to `$HOME/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/<tokenSymbol>`.
- Access to the private key that currently owns the warp route.
