# Deploy a Warp Route

_Create an interchain route for your token_

A Warp Route is a type of [router](../reference/libraries/router.mdx) application, requiring a `HypERC20` or `HypERC721` token contract to be deployed on each chain you wish to support.

:::info

Check out the [Warp Route](/docs/reference/applications/warp-routes) reference page for more information on the interface and security implications of a Warp Route.

:::

## Prerequisites

* [Hyperlane CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperlane-xyz/cli)
* A private key for contract transaction signing

## 1. Configuration

### Warp Route deployment config

To deploy the route, you will need a Warp Route deployment config file. A valid config will specify:
* Which token, on which chain, is this Warp Route being created for?
* _Optional:_ Hyperlane connection details including contract addresses for the [mailbox](../reference/messaging/messaging-interface.mdx), [interchain gas](../reference/hooks/interchain-gas.mdx), and [interchain security modules](../reference/ISM/specify-your-ISM.mdx).
* _Optional:_ The token standard - fungible tokens using ERC20 or NFTs using ERC721. Defaults to ERC20.

The easiest way to create one is with the CLI's config command:

```bash
hyperlane config create warp
```

:::tip

If your config looks correct, you can now skip to [Step 2: Deployment](#2-deployment).
Or see below for details on how to define your config manually.

:::

#### Base

Your config must have exactly one `base` entry. Here you will configure details about the token for which you are creating a Warp Route.

* **chainName**: Set this equal to the chain on which your token exists
* **type**: 
    - Set this to `TokenType.collateral` to create a basic Warp Route for an ERC20/ERC721 token.
    - Set this to `TokenType.collateralVault` to create a yield-bearing Warp Route for an ERC20 token that deposits into an ERC4626 vault.
    - Set this to `TokenType.native` to create a Warp Route for a native token (e.g. ether)
* **address:** 
    - If using `TokenType.collateral`, the address of the ERC20/ERC721 contract for which to create a route
    - If using `TokenType.collateralVault`, the address of the ERC4626 vault to deposit collateral into
* **isNft:** If using `TokenType.collateral` for an ERC721 contract, set to `true`.

#### Synthetics

Your config must have at least one `synthetics` entry. Here you will configure details about the remote chains supported by your Warp Route.

* **chainName:** Set this equal to the chain on which you want a wrapped version of your token

#### Optional fields

You may specify the following optional values in your `base` and `synthetics` entries. If no values are provided, the deployer will attempt to pull these values from elsewhere. In the case of metadata (symbol, name decimals), it will query the contract. For addresses (mailbox, ISM) it will check the core deployment artifacts, either yours (if provided) or the [SDK's](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/typescript/sdk/src/consts/environments/mainnet.json).

* **symbol:** The token symbol
* **name:** The token name
* **decimals:** The number of decimal places for the token
* **mailbox:** The address of the the [mailbox](../reference/messaging/messaging-interface.mdx) contract to use to send and receive messages
* **interchainSecurityModule:** The address of an [interchain security modules](../reference/ISM/specify-your-ISM.mdx) to verify interchain messages

#### Example

For a minimal Warp deployment config example using local anvil chains, see [`warp-route-deployment.yaml`](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/typescript/cli/examples/warp-route-deployment.yaml).

### Chain config

The Warp Route deployment will require basic information about any chains it will be interacting with. If the target chains include any not already in the Hyperlane SDK, you must specify chain metadata for it.

To see what chains are in the SDK, run the following command:

```bash
hyperlane chains list
```

To create a chain metadata config for any other chains, run the following command:

```bash
hyperlane config create chain
```

Or you can define the config manually. See the [ChainMetadata type](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/typescript/sdk/src/metadata/chainMetadataTypes.ts#L62) for its schema. A minimal example can be found in [`anvil-chains.yaml`](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/typescript/cli/examples/anvil-chains.yaml).

## 2. Deployment

Run the following command to initiate the Warp Route deployment:

```bash
hyperlane deploy warp
```

Once finished, the CLI will create two new JSON artifact files: `warp-deployment` and `warp-ui-token-config`. The first contains just addresses for the newly deployed Warp router contracts. The second is a config file for the Warp UI, which you can use for the next optional step.

## 3. Testing

You can initiate a test transfer of a single wei with the following command:

```bash
hyperlane send transfer
```

If everything goes well, you should see the output similar to the following:

```
Waiting for message delivery on destination chain
Waiting for message delivery on destination chain
Waiting for message delivery on destination chain
Message delivered on destination chain!
Confirmed balance increase
Warp test transfer complete
```

## 4. (Optional) Warp UI

The Warp UI is a DApp template for interacting with Warp Routes. See the [Warp UI docs](./deploy-warp-route-UI.mdx) for details on how to set it up.
