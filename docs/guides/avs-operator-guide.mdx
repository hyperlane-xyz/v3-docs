# Hyperlane AVS Operator Guide for Holesky

Hyperlane validators are extremely lightweight off-chain agents responsible for observing the [Mailbox](../protocol/mailbox.mdx) on the source chain contract and, if required, signing a merkle root to faciliate message transmission to remote chains.

### Prerequisites

- Install the `@hyperlane-xyz/cli` package versioned `3.20.0-alpha` with `npm install -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli@3.20.0-alpha`. Follow more detailed instructions for installation [here](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/cli).

## Register your operator

:::warning

There is a distinction between the operator key and the AVS signing key. The operator key is meant for just interacting with the AVS contracts whereas the AVS signing key is used for active operations, which in our case will be signing checkpoints with a Hyperlane validator.

:::

To register with Hyperlane, operators must first register their operating key as an operator on the Eigenlayer smart contracts on Holesky testnet. You can follow Eigenlayer's instructions [here](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-installation#operator-configuration-and-registration) (only need the ECDSA key).

Next, to register your operator to Hyperlane AVS, you can register your operator key (generated via EigenLayer CLI) by creating an ECDSA signature and submitting it via the Hyperlane CLI:

```bash
 hyperlane avs register --operatorKeyPath <PATH_TO_OPERATOR_KEY> \
    --chain holesky --key <HYP_KEY> \
    --avsSigningKey <AVS_SIGNING_KEY>
```

### Running the validator

Follow the validator guide [here](../operate/validators/run-validators.mdx) with the AWS setup to run the validator on any chain you prefer (Holesky will be the simplest). Make sure your KMS key will have funds on that chain to announce itself.

You can monitor Eigenlayer specific endpoints via the `--metrics` port you specified in the validator configuration. Read more about the example endpoints and what should be expected [here](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/avs-guides/spec/api/).

The supported endpoints are:

| Endpoint                     | Description                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **GET /eigen/node**          | for node info                              |
| **GET /eigen/node/health**   | for node health                            |
| **GET /eigen/node/services** | for a list of services the node is running |
