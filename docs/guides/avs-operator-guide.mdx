# Hyperlane AVS Operator Guide for Holesky

## Overview

Hyperlane validators are extremely lightweight off-chain agents responsible for observing the [Mailbox](../protocol/mailbox.mdx) on the source chain contract and, if required, signing a merkle root to faciliate message transmission to remote chains. Learn more about the AVS protocol design [here](../protocol/avs.mdx).

## 0. Prerequisites

Install the latest version of the `@hyperlane-xyz/cli` package with `npm install -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli`. Follow more detailed instructions for installation [here](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/cli).

## 1. Running the validator

Follow the validator guide [here](../operate/validators/run-validators.mdx) with the AWS setup to run the validator on any chain you prefer (Holesky will be the simplest). Make sure your KMS key will have funds on that chain to announce itself.

You can monitor Eigenlayer specific endpoints via the `--metrics` port you specified in the validator configuration. Read more about the example endpoints and what should be expected [here](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/avs-guides/spec/api/).

The supported endpoints are:

| Endpoint                     | Description                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **GET /eigen/node**          | for node info                              |
| **GET /eigen/node/health**   | for node health                            |
| **GET /eigen/node/services** | for a list of services the node is running |

You'll need the validator address (address of the signing key) for the next step.

## 2. Set up keys

There is a distinction between the operator key and the AVS signing key. The operator key is meant for just interacting with the AVS contracts whereas the AVS signing key is used for active operations, which in our case will be signing checkpoints with a Hyperlane validator.

## 3. Register your operator

To register with the Hyperlane AVS, operators must first register their operating key as an operator on the Eigenlayer smart contracts on Holesky testnet. You can follow Eigenlayer's instructions [here](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-installation#operator-configuration-and-registration) (only need the ECDSA key).

Next, to register your operator to Hyperlane AVS, you can register your operator key (generated via EigenLayer CLI) by creating an ECDSA signature and submitting it with the AVS sigining key (validator address from the previous step) via the Hyperlane CLI:

```bash
 hyperlane avs register --operatorKeyPath <PATH_TO_OPERATOR_KEY> \
    --chain holesky \
    --avsSigningKey <AVS_SIGNING_KEY>
```

:::success

After receiving confirmation from the CLI, you would have successfully registered on the AVS and Hyperlane message receivers can now leverage your validators signatures for security. You can also support many chains with the same AVS signing key if you're running the operator for different chains.
