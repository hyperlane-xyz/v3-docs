# Hyperlane Local Setup Guide: Sending Messages between Anvil Nodes

This guide walks you through sending interchain messages between two local Anvil nodes using the Hyperlane CLI.

## Prerequisites

- **[Hyperlane CLI](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/cli):** Make sure you have the latest version of the Hyperlane CLI installed.

  ```bash
  npm install -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli
  ```

- **[Anvil (foundry)](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation):** Installed to run local chains. Install it via
  ```bash
  curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
  ```
- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **Deployer Wallet Private Key**: You need a funded wallet for deploying contracts. This will be used as the HYP_KEY.
  ```bash
  export HYP_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
  ```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Environment Setup: Create a working directory for the Hyperlane configuration:

```bash
mkdir hyperlane-local-test && cd hyperlane-local-test
```

### 2. Start Two Distinct Anvil Nodes

We will run two Anvil nodes with unique chain IDs.

- On a first terminal, start the first Anvil node:

  ```bash
  anvil --port 8545 --chain-id 31337 --block-time 1
  ```

  - Runs on `http://localhost:8545`.
  - Chain ID: `31337`.

- In a new terminal, start the second Anvil node: :

  ```bash
  anvil --port 8546 --chain-id 31338 --block-time 1
  ```

  - Runs on `http://localhost:8546`.
  - Chain ID: `31338`.

### 3. Initialize the Hyperlane Registry

On a new terminal, use the Hyperlane CLI to create configurations for both Anvil nodes:

```bash
hyperlane registry init
```

Follow the prompts to set up `anvilnode1`. The CLI will ask you for the details of your chains including chainId and RPC URLs. Repeat the process for `anvilnode2`.

This process will create `metadata.yaml` files under `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains/anvilnode1` and `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains/anvilnode2`.

Example metadata:

- **anvilnode1**

```yaml
chainId: 31337
displayName: Anvilnode1
domainId: 31337
isTestnet: true
name: anvilnode1
nativeToken:
  decimals: 18
  name: ETH
  symbol: ETH
protocol: ethereum
rpcUrls:
  - http: http://localhost:8545
```

- **anvilnode2**

```yaml
chainId: 31338
displayName: Anvilnode2
domainId: 31338
isTestnet: true
name: anvilnode2
nativeToken:
  decimals: 18
  name: ETH
  symbol: ETH
protocol: ethereum
rpcUrls:
  - http: http://localhost:8546
```

### 4. Deploy Core Contracts

We'll configure and deploy Hyperlane core contracts.

:::tip
You'll need the deployer wallet private key to deploy the core contracts. You can use `export HYP_KEY='<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>'` to set the private key as an environment variable.
:::

```bash
hyperlane core init
```

The deployment configuration will be saved to `./configs/core-config.yaml`.

Next, deploy the core contracts:

```bash
hyperlane core deploy
```

Follow the prompts to select `anvilnode1`. The CLI will deploy Mailbox, Interchain Security Modules (ISMs), and other required contracts. Repeat the process for `anvilnode2`.

Once complete, you‚Äôll find `addresses.yaml` in `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains/anvilnode1` and `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains/anvilnode2`, with the deployed contract addresses.

:::tip
You should be able to see the messages of the contract deployments on your terminals running the local nodes.
:::

### 5. Send a Test Message

Use the Hyperlane CLI to send a message from `anvilnode1` to `anvilnode2`.

```bash
hyperlane send message --relay
```

The CLI will prompt you to provide the origin chain (`anvilnode1`) and the destination chain (`anvilnode2`).

:::tip

For local testing, the `--relay` flag automatically relays the message to the destination chain.

:::

After sending the message, check the following:

- Validator Logs: Look for entries indicating that signatures were generated and stored.
- Relayer Logs: Look for successful metadata retrieval and message processing.
- Anvil Logs: Ensure blocks were mined to process the transactions.

:::success
üéâ You've sent a message between two local Anvil nodes using Hyperlane!

## Troubleshooting

1. ‚ÄúCould not fetch metadata‚Äù warning:

   - **Reason:** This occurs when the relayer cannot retrieve validator signatures required to process a message. Common causes:
     - The validator key lacks testnet funds.
     - The validator has not announced its storage locations.
   - **Solution:**
     - Ensure the validators have announced their storage locations. Check validator logs for a message such as: `Validator has announced signature storage location, locations: ["file:///tmp/hyperlane-validator-signatures-local"].`
     - Verify that each validator has a unique signature storage path (`--checkpointSyncer.path`) to prevent overwriting.
     - Confirm that the relayer has read access to the storage paths.

2. Messages time out:

   - **Reason:** Anvil doesn't auto-mine blocks by default, causing validators or relayers to wait indefinitely for new blocks.
   - **Solution:** Make sure to use the `--block-time 1 flag` when starting Anvil to auto-mine blocks every second.

3. Validator mismatch or misconfiguration:

   - **Reason:** The ISM configuration on the destination chain does not match the validator key(s) used by the origin chain.
   - **Solution:** Check that the ISM configuration includes the correct validator addresses. Validator logs can help identify the announced addresses.
