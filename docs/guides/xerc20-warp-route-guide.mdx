# Create your xERC20 Token Bridge

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you should have:

1. **An origin and destination network of choice**, between which you’d like to deploy the xERC20 warp route.
2. **The address of an xERC20 or xERC20Lockbox** on the origin and destination chain. 
3. **Hyperlane CLI installed** and a **wallet private key set as the `HYP_KEY` environment variable**, funded on both origin and destination networks.

### Step 1: Initialize a New Warp Route

Run the following command to generate a warp route configuration:

```bash
hyperlane warp init
```

1. Select **Ethereum** (origin) and **YourChain** (destination) using space, then hit enter.
2. For Ethereum (origin), choose **xERC20** or **xERC20Lockbox**, and enter the contract address. 
3. For YourChain (destination), choose **xERC20** or **xERC20Lockbox**, and enter the contract address.

Choosing Between xERC20 and xERC20Lockbox:

- **xERC20Lockbox**: Use this if your token is already deployed on the origin chain and requires a wrapped version for cross-chain transfers.
- **xERC20**: Use this if your token natively implements xERC20 and does not require a lockbox.

If you're unsure, review your token’s contract structure or deployment history to determine the correct choice.

### Step 2: Deploy the xERC20 Warp Route

Run the following command to deploy the warp route:

```bash
hyperlane warp deploy
```

This deploys the *Hyperlane adapter contracts**, either:

- **HypXERC20Lockbox** (if using xERC20Lockbox)
- **HypXERC20** (if using xERC20)

*The CLI does not deploy non-Hyperlane contracts (e.g., existing ERC20 contracts). Those should already be deployed.*

### Step 3: Configure Minting Permissions

Once the xERC20 warp route contracts are deployed, you must configure minting permissions for the destination token.

Set the mint limit using the [`setLimits` function](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/xERC20/blob/main/solidity/contracts/XERC20.sol#L85) in your xERC20 contract.

### Step 4: Test Cross-Chain Transfers

Test transferring tokens across chains using:

```bash
hyperlane warp send --symbol <token_symbol> --amount <amount>
```

- Replace `<token_symbol>` with your token.
- Replace `<amount>` with the number of tokens to transfer.

### 

🎉 Congrats! You have successfully created an **xERC20 Warp Route**. Your xERC20 tokens can now move across chains!

:::warning
Please note that cross-chain operations rely on **Interchain Security Modules (ISMs)**, and there are inherent risks, such as ISM trust assumptions.
