# 2) Registry: create your custom chain entry

<aside>
💡 Internal: `hyperlane config create` be replaced with `hyperlane registry configure`, this command does not exist yet

</aside>

## Configure: `hyperlane config create`

→ TLDR: Generate a new chain configuration for use by `core deploy` and `warp deploy`.

### Steps

1. Run:
    
    ```bash
    hyperlane config create chain
    ```
    
    1. Reject the first prompt `? Detected rpc url as [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545/) from JSON RPC provider, is this correct? (Y/n)` and enter your chain’s rpc
    2. For `? Enter http or https rpc url`, enter a RPC http URL for your custom chain
        1. For example: `https://hyper-lane-docs.rpc.caldera.xyz/http` 
    3. For `? Enter chain name (one word, lower case)`, enter the name of your custom chain
        1. For example: `yourchain`
    4. For `? Detected chain id as 171717 from JSON RPC provider, is this correct? (Y/n)`, confirm the chain id is correct, or respond with `n` and `? Enter a (number) chain id`
        1. For example: `171717`
    5. For `? Do you want to set block or gas properties for this chain config? (y/N)`, confirm whether you’d like to set these properties or not
    6. After completing the block/gas properties or selecting `N`, you will see the following:
        
        ```tsx
        Chain config is valid, writing to registry
        Skipping updating chain yourchain at github registry
        Now updating chain yourchain at filesystem registry at $HOME/.hyperlane
        Done updating chain yourchain at filesystem registry
        ```
        
    7. Under `$HOME/hyperlane-registry/chains/` you will find a new folder named with your custom chain’s name, and a file named `metadata.yaml` within that folder.
        
        At the end of `metadata.yaml, add:
        
        ```yaml
        nativeToken:
          name: Ether
          symbol: ETH
          decimals: 18
        ```
        
        1. Example contents of this config at `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains/yourchain/metadata.yaml` :
            
            ```yaml
            # yaml-language-server: $schema=../schema.json
            name: yourchain
            chainId: 171717
            domainId: 171717
            protocol: ethereum
            rpcUrls:
              - http: https://hyper-lane-docs.rpc.caldera.xyz/http
            nativeToken:
              name: Ether
              symbol: ETH
              decimals: 18
            ```

# 3) Core: define & deploy your custom chain’s core contracts

## Configure: `hyperlane core configure`

→ TLDR: Generate a new core configuration for use by `core deploy`.

### Steps

1. From your local environment, source the private key or seed phrase of your funded deployer address via `HYP_KEY`
    1. For example: `export HYP_KEY='<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>'`
2. Verify your `HYP_KEY` is sourced correctly via `echo $HYP_KEY`
3. From the same instance, run:
    
    ```bash
    hyperlane core configure
    ```
    
    1. For `? Detected owner address as 0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb from signer, is this correct? (Y/n)`, confirm or update the displayed address
    2. After confirming or updating the owner to your funded deployer address, you will see the following:
        
        ```tsx
        Creating trustedRelayerIsm...
        Created trustedRelayerIsm!
        Creating merkleTreeHook...
        Created merkleTreeHook!
        Creating protocolFee...
        Created protocolFee!
        Core config is valid, writing to file ./configs/core-config.yaml:
        
            owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
            defaultIsm:
              type: trustedRelayerIsm
              relayer: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
            defaultHook:
              type: merkleTreeHook
            requiredHook:
              owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
              type: protocolFee
              beneficiary: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
              maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
              protocolFee: "0"
            
        ✅ Successfully created new core deployment config.
        ```
        
    3. Under `./configs` you will find a file named `core-config.yaml`
        1. Example contents of this config based on the above examples:
            
            ```yaml
            owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
            defaultIsm:
              type: trustedRelayerIsm
              relayer: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
            defaultHook:
              type: merkleTreeHook
            requiredHook:
              owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
              type: protocolFee
              beneficiary: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
              maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
              protocolFee: "0"
            ```
            

## Deploy: `hyperlane core deploy`

→ TLDR: Deploy a new core configuration on your custom chain.

### Steps

1. Verify your `HYP_KEY` is sourced correctly via `echo $HYP_KEY`
2. From the same instance, run:
    
    ```bash
    hyperlane core deploy
    ```
    
    1. For `? Select chain to connect`, arrow up or down to the name of your custom chain, and hit `enter`
        1. For example: `❯ yourchain` 
    2. Confirm with `Y` when you see the following displayed:
        
        ```bash
        Deployment plan
        ===============
        Transaction signer and owner of new contracts will be 0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb
        Deploying to yourchain
        There are several contracts required for each chain but contracts in your provided registries will be skipped
        ? Is this deployment plan correct? (Y/n)
        ```
        
    3. Hyperlane will now begin deploying to your custom chain. Please wait until the deployment completes.
    4. Once deployment is complete, you will see the following:
        
        ```bash
        ⛽️ Gas Usage Statistics
                - Gas required for core deploy on yourchain: 0.03041933761044786 ETH
        Now updating chain yourchain at filesystem registry at $HOME/hyperlane-registry
        Done updating chain yourchain at filesystem registry
        Now updating chain yourchain at filesystem registry at $HOME/.hyperlane
        Done updating chain yourchain at filesystem registry
        Deployment is complete!
        ```
        
    5. Under `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains` you will find a new folder named with your custom chain’s name, and a file named `addresses.yaml` within that folder
        1. Example contents of this config at `$HOME/hyperlane-registry/chains/yourchain/addresses.yaml` based on the above examples:
            
            ```yaml
            staticMerkleRootMultisigIsmFactory: "0x6906cb4741d3E2322E9f9aA645DfC8AB6F122c47"

## Send: `hyperlane send message`

→ TLDR: Send a test message to your custom chain using self-relay.

### Steps

1. Verify your `HYP_KEY` is sourced correctly via `echo $HYP_KEY`
2. From the same instance, run:
    
    ```bash
    hyperlane send message --relay
    ```
    
    1. For `? Select the origin chain`, arrow up or down to **another** chain name and hit `enter` 
        1. For example: `❯ fuji` 
    2. For `? Select the destination chain`, arrow up or down to your custom chain name and hit `enter`
        1. For example: `❯ yourchain`
    3. You will now see the following:

# 4) Warp Route: define & deploy your custom chain’s warp route contracts

## Configure: `hyperlane warp configure`

→ TLDR: Generate a new warp configuration for use by `warp deploy`.

### Steps

1. Verify your `HYP_KEY` is sourced correctly via `echo $HYP_KEY`
2. From the same instance, run:
    
    ```bash
    hyperlane warp configure
    ```
    
    1. For `? Detected owner address as 0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb from signer, is this correct? (Y/n)`, confirm or update the displayed address
    2. For `? Select chains to connect`, arrow up or down to your custom chain name and hit `space`, then navigate to another chain name on which your deployer address has funds and hit `space`, then hit `enter`
        1. For example: `yourchain, fuji`
    3. For `? Select yourchain's token type`, select the token type you’d like your warp route to support on your custom chain
        1. For example: `native`
    4. For `? Detected mailbox address as 0x5F58d75A9caDE4e2b191313223978dF049f93b81 from hyperlane-registry, is this correct? (Y/n)`, confirm with `Y` 
    5. For `? Select fuji's token type`, select the token type you’d like your warp route to support on your other chain selection
        1. For example: `synthetic` or another `native`
    6. for `? Detected mailbox address as 0x094d03E751f49908080EFf000Dd6FD177fd44CC3 from hyperlane-registry, is this correct? (Y/n)`, confirm with `Y`

## Deploy: `hyperlane warp deploy`

→ TLDR: Deploy a new warp configuration on your custom chain.

### Steps

1. Verify your `HYP_KEY` is sourced correctly via `echo $HYP_KEY`
2. From the same instance, run:
    
    ```bash
    hyperlane warp deploy
    ```
    
    1. Confirm `Y` when you see the following displayed:
        
        ```tsx
        Hyperlane warp route deployment
        ------------------------------------------------
        Using warp route deployment config at ./configs/warp-route-deployment.yaml

💡 **Congrats! A Hyperlane warp route is now deployed to your custom chain  🎉 Let’s move on to sending a test message from your custom chain.**

</aside>

## Send: `hyperlane warp send`

→ TLDR: Send a message from your custom chain using self-relay.

### Steps

1. Verify your `HYP_KEY` is sourced correctly via `echo $HYP_KEY`
2. From the same instance, run:
    
    ```bash
    hyperlane warp send --relay
    ```
    
    1. For `? Select the origin chain`, arrow up or down to your custom chain name and hit `enter`
        1. For example: `❯ yourchain`
    2. For `? Select the destination chain`, arrow up or down to your other chain selection and hit `enter`
        1. For example: `❯ fuji` 
    3. You will now see the following:

# 5) Submit to Registry: ensure your custom configs & deployments are available in the registry

→ TLDR: Submit your new chain, core, and warp configurations the the Hyperlane registry.

### Steps

1. Navigate to your local instance of the registry and commit changes

```bash
cd ~/.hyperlane && git init && git add . && git commit
```

1. Sync local registry with canonical registry

```bash
git remote add canonical git@github.com:hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry.git
git pull canonical main --rebase
```

1. Push local registry to github fork and submit a PR
