# How to Transfer Mailbox Ownership

# Using the Hyperlane CLI

One of the quickest way to transfer a mailbox ownership is by using the [Hyperlane CLI](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/cli).

## Prerequisites

- The core config generated by `hyperlane core init`.
    - This config is used to deploy core contracts, including the mailbox. By default, it takes the filepath of `CURRENT_DIR/configs/core-config.yaml`.
- The core deployment artifacts generated by `hyperlane core deploy`.
    - This deployment artifact file is generated by a core deployment. By default, it is written to `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains/CHAIN/addresses.yaml`.
- Access to the private key that currently owns the mailbox.

:::info
If you followed the [How to Connect Your Chain with Hyperlane](/docs/deploy-hyperlane) guide, you may have deployed a mailbox with the owner set to the single private key. In production, it is advisable to use a multisig.

To confirm using the Hyperlane CLI, execute the following with `--chain` set to the name of your chain that the mailbox is deployed on:

```bash
hyperlane core read --chain yourchain
```

After running `core read`, you should see a similar config with `owner` set to private key's address:

```yaml {8}
defaultHook:
  address: "0xC2E88eC0aB5FDB9756CD3EFEE40D24120fFa6E57"
  type: "merkleTreeHook"
defaultIsm:
  address: "0xF37395A79f56268FD0040E1f5711e9Af974a545A"
  relayer: "0xa5558cA30cd9952Ab0e2349C274a3736698bD60e"
  type: "trustedRelayerIsm"
owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
requiredHook:
  address: "0x390d29a822C21F57B163F1173cD43382bd643401"
  beneficiary: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
  owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  protocolFee: "0"
  type: "protocolFee"
```

The output is saved to `CURRENT_DIR/configs/core-config.yaml`.

Follow these steps using the CLI to transfer the existing ownership to another address.

## Step 1: Update Config

Update `owner` address in the `core-config.yaml`

```diff title="core-config.yaml"
defaultHook:
  address: "0xE71AC7A1ccB822423576EfFdb0B74564C49BEcBA"
  type: merkleTreeHook
defaultIsm:
  address: "0x89842f40928f81FC4415b39bfBFC3205eB6161cB"
  relayer: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  type: trustedRelayerIsm
- owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
+ owner: "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8"
requiredHook:
  address: "0x390d29a822C21F57B163F1173cD43382bd643401"
  beneficiary: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
  owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  protocolFee: "0"
  type: protocolFee
```

## Step 2: Apply

Using the CLI, execute:

```bash
hyperlane core apply --chain yourchain
```

You should see a batch of transactions executed on chain, and a final message indicating that the mailbox has been updated.

## Step 3: Confirm

To confirm using the Hyperlane CLI, execute the following:

```bash
hyperlane core read --chain yourchain
```

After running `core read`, you should see a similar config with the now updated `owner`:

```yaml {8}
defaultHook:
  address: "0x67F8c06Fd2915728E9D21451E33FbDFbCcd63c44"
  type: "merkleTreeHook"
defaultIsm:
  address: "0xac7D6df90fa937ADEfE7aD2d4905f0AEa170c467"
  relayer: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  type: "trustedRelayerIsm"
owner: "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8"
requiredHook:
  address: "0x1Cd94b4D9B5f0e3474a6bDB8b9503Ca84F53e548"
  beneficiary: "0xa5558cA30cd9952Ab0e2349C274a3736698bD60e"
  maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
  owner: "0xa5558cA30cd9952Ab0e2349C274a3736698bD60e"
  protocolFee: "0"
  type: "protocolFee"
```

By completing these steps, you have successfully transferred and verified ownership of your mailbox to a new address.
