# How to Transfer Ownership from Hyperlane Mailbox

This guide explains how to change the owner of your Hyperlane Mailbox using the Hyperlane CLI. Transferring ownership is necessary when you want to give control to a different address, such as for security reasons or when making changes to who manages the Mailbox.

As the new owner, you will have full control over the Mailbox settings, including managing hooks, ISM configurations, and permissions for message handling. Weâ€™ll guide you through updating the owner address, applying the change, and confirming everything is set correctly.

# Using the Hyperlane CLI

One of the quickest way to transfer a mailbox ownership is by using the [Hyperlane CLI](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/cli).

<PrerequisitesPartial />

:::info
If you followed the [How to Connect Your Chain with Hyperlane](/docs/deploy-hyperlane) guide, you may have deployed a mailbox with the owner set to the single private key. In production, it is advisable to use a multisig.
:::

To confirm using the Hyperlane CLI, execute the following with `--chain` set to the name of your chain that the mailbox is deployed on:

<CoreReadChainPartial />

After running `core read`, you should see a similar config with `owner` set to private key's address:

```yaml {8}
defaultHook:
  address: "0xC2E88eC0aB5FDB9756CD3EFEE40D24120fFa6E57"
  type: "merkleTreeHook"
defaultIsm:
  address: "0xF37395A79f56268FD0040E1f5711e9Af974a545A"
  relayer: "0xa5558cA30cd9952Ab0e2349C274a3736698bD60e"
  type: "trustedRelayerIsm"
owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
requiredHook:
  address: "0x390d29a822C21F57B163F1173cD43382bd643401"
  beneficiary: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
  owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  protocolFee: "0"
  type: "protocolFee"
```

The output is saved to `CURRENT_DIR/configs/core-config.yaml`.

Follow these steps using the CLI to transfer the existing ownership to another address.

## Step 1: Update Config

Update `owner` address in the `core-config.yaml`

```diff title="core-config.yaml"
defaultHook:
  address: "0xE71AC7A1ccB822423576EfFdb0B74564C49BEcBA"
  type: merkleTreeHook
defaultIsm:
  address: "0x89842f40928f81FC4415b39bfBFC3205eB6161cB"
  relayer: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  type: trustedRelayerIsm
- owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
+ owner: "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8"
requiredHook:
  address: "0x390d29a822C21F57B163F1173cD43382bd643401"
  beneficiary: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
  owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  protocolFee: "0"
  type: protocolFee
```

## Step 2: Apply

Using the CLI, execute:

<CoreApplyChainPartial />

You should see a batch of transactions executed on chain, and a final message indicating that the mailbox has been updated.

## Step 3: Confirm

To confirm using the Hyperlane CLI, execute the following:

<CoreReadChainPartial />

After running `core read`, you should see a similar config with the now updated `owner`:

```yaml {8}
defaultHook:
  address: "0x67F8c06Fd2915728E9D21451E33FbDFbCcd63c44"
  type: "merkleTreeHook"
defaultIsm:
  address: "0xac7D6df90fa937ADEfE7aD2d4905f0AEa170c467"
  relayer: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  type: "trustedRelayerIsm"
owner: "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8"
requiredHook:
  address: "0x1Cd94b4D9B5f0e3474a6bDB8b9503Ca84F53e548"
  beneficiary: "0xa5558cA30cd9952Ab0e2349C274a3736698bD60e"
  maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
  owner: "0xa5558cA30cd9952Ab0e2349C274a3736698bD60e"
  protocolFee: "0"
  type: "protocolFee"
```

By completing these steps, you have successfully transferred and verified ownership of your mailbox to a new address.
