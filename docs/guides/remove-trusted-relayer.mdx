# Remove Trusted Relayer ISM

# Using the Hyperlane CLI

One of the quickest way to remove the trusted relayer ISM is by using the [Hyperlane CLI](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/cli).

## Prerequisites

- Warp Deployment Config
    - This deployment config is used for deploying a warp route. By default, it takes the filepath of `CURRENT_DIR/warp-route-deployment.yaml`
- Warp Deployment Artifacts
    - This artifact file is created **after** deploying a warp route. By default, it is written to `$HOME/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/TOKEN/chain1-chain2-config.yaml`
- Private Key that currently owns the warp route

:::info
If you followed the [Deploy a Warp Route](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/guides/deploy-warp-route) guide, you most likely have deployed a warp route with a trusted relayer set to a signer address.
:::

To confirm using the CLI, execute:

```bash
hyperlane warp read --address 0x... --chain yourchain
```

Under `interchainSecurityModule`, you may see a similar config:

```yaml {7-9}
yourchain:
  ...
  interchainSecurityModule:
    address: "0xd54d32cD6a62482497252D59E6cCC1445fF0b92d"
    type: "staticAggregationIsm"
    modules:
      - address: "0x50b6dA835D9b8b20523891410a2E042855B465C8"
        relayer: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
        type: "trustedRelayerIsm"
      - owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
        address: "0xcE512189fF1BD41186E9eDda02BF321Fb1FC6eAc"
        type: "defaultFallbackRoutingIsm"
        domains: {}
    threshold: 1
```
This particular config has a `trustedRelayerIsm` as part of the `staticAggregationIsm`.

This means that the `relayer` address will be allowed to call the Warp Routeâ€™s `handle()` function. In other words, the `relayer` can execute arbitrary messages on the Warp Route. This may be undesirable in cases outside of the self-relaying feature.

## Step 1: Configuration

If you have the `warp-route-deployment.yaml` used to deploy your warp route, skip to step 2. Otherwise, run the following command, and save the output to `warp-route-deployment.yaml` 

```bash
hyperlane warp read --address 0x... --chain yourchain
```

Update the `warp-route-deployment.yaml` by **removing** the `trustedRelayerIsm` block from `modules` . Alternatively, you can configure the entire `modules` block as desired.

```diff title="warp-route-deployment.yaml"
yourchain:
  mailbox: '0x979Ca5202784112f4738403dBec5D0F3B9daabB9'
  owner: '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266'
  interchainSecurityModule:
    address: '0xd54d32cD6a62482497252D59E6cCC1445fF0b92d'
    type: 'staticAggregationIsm'
    modules:
-     - address: '0x50b6dA835D9b8b20523891410a2E042855B465C8'
-       relayer: '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266'
-       type: trustedRelayerIsm
      - owner: '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266'
        address: '0xcE512189fF1BD41186E9eDda02BF321Fb1FC6eAc'
        type: 'defaultFallbackRoutingIsm'
        domains: {}
    threshold: 1
  name: Ether
  symbol: ETH
  decimals: 18
  totalSupply: 0
  type: native

```

## Step 2: Apply

Using the CLI, execute:

```bash
hyperlane warp apply --warp $HOME/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/ETH/yourchain-config.yaml --config ./warp-route-deployment.yaml
```

You should see a batch of transactions executed on chain, and a final message indicating that the warp config has been updated.

## Step 3: Confirm

Using the CLI, execute:

```bash
hyperlane warp read --address 0x... --chain yourchain
```

Confirm that trusted relayer ISM has been removed:

```yaml
yourchain:
  mailbox: "0x979Ca5202784112f4738403dBec5D0F3B9daabB9"
  owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  interchainSecurityModule:
    address: "0x8af9445d8A3FbFBd1D5dF185B8a4533Ab060Cf36"
    type: "staticAggregationIsm"
    modules:
      - owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
        address: "0xBe0232d5d45f9aD8322C2C4F84c39e64302Cd996"
        type: "defaultFallbackRoutingIsm"
        domains: {}
    threshold: 1
  name: "Ether"
  symbol: "ETH"
  decimals: 18
  totalSupply: 0
  type: "native"
```
