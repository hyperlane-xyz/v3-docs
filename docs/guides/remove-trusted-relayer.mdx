# How to Remove the Trusted Relayer ISM from your Hyperlane Warp Route

# Using the Hyperlane CLI

When first deploying with the CLI, new warp routes use a Trusted Relayer ISM out of the box so you don't need to run a relayer or validator.

In order to go to production, you'll need to remove this ISM with the Hyperlane CLI.

## Prerequisites

- The warp route config generated by `hyperlane warp init`.
    - This config is used to deploy a warp route. By default, it takes the filepath of `CURRENT_DIR/warp-route-deployment.yaml`.
- The warp route deployment artifacts generated by `hyperlane warp deploy`.
    - This deployment artifact file is generated by a warp route deployment. By default, it is written to `$HOME/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/TOKEN/chain1-chain2-config.yaml`.
- Access to the private key that currently owns the warp route.

:::info
If you followed the Deploy a Warp Route guide, you most likely have deployed a warp route with a trusted relayer set to a signer address.
:::

To confirm using the Hyperlane CLI, locate your warp route under the `/deployments/warp_routes` directory, and execute the following with `address` set to the `addressOrDenom` of your warp route:

```bash
hyperlane warp read --address <addressOrDenom> --chain yourchain
```

After running `warp read`, you should see a similar config under `interchainSecurityModule` containing a `trustedRelayerIsm`:

```yaml {7-9}
yourchain:
  ...
  interchainSecurityModule:
    address: "0xd54d32cD6a62482497252D59E6cCC1445fF0b92d"
    type: "staticAggregationIsm"
    modules:
      - address: "0x50b6dA835D9b8b20523891410a2E042855B465C8"
        relayer: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
        type: "trustedRelayerIsm"
      - owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
        address: "0xcE512189fF1BD41186E9eDda02BF321Fb1FC6eAc"
        type: "defaultFallbackRoutingIsm"
        domains: {}
    threshold: 1
```
This particular config has a `trustedRelayerIsm` as part of the `staticAggregationIsm`.

This means that the `relayer` address will be allowed to call the Warp Route’s `handle()` function. In other words, the `relayer` can execute arbitrary messages on the Warp Route. This may be undesirable in cases outside of the self-relaying feature.

## Step 1: Configuration

If you have the `warp-route-deployment.yaml` used to deploy your warp route, skip to step 2. Otherwise, run the following command, and save the output to `warp-route-deployment.yaml`

```bash
hyperlane warp read --address 0x... --chain yourchain
```

Update the `warp-route-deployment.yaml` by **removing** the `trustedRelayerIsm` block from `modules` . Alternatively, you can configure the entire `modules` block as desired.

```diff title="warp-route-deployment.yaml"
yourchain:
  mailbox: '0x979Ca5202784112f4738403dBec5D0F3B9daabB9'
  owner: '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266'
  interchainSecurityModule:
    address: '0xd54d32cD6a62482497252D59E6cCC1445fF0b92d'
    type: 'staticAggregationIsm'
    modules:
-     - address: '0x50b6dA835D9b8b20523891410a2E042855B465C8'
-       relayer: '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266'
-       type: trustedRelayerIsm
      - owner: '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266'
        address: '0xcE512189fF1BD41186E9eDda02BF321Fb1FC6eAc'
        type: 'defaultFallbackRoutingIsm'
        domains: {}
    threshold: 1
  name: Ether
  symbol: ETH
  decimals: 18
  totalSupply: 0
  type: native

```

## Step 2: Apply

Using the CLI, execute:

```bash
hyperlane warp apply --warp $HOME/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/ETH/yourchain-config.yaml --config ./warp-route-deployment.yaml
```

You should see a batch of transactions executed on chain, and a final message indicating that the warp config has been updated.

## Step 3: Confirm

To confirm using the Hyperlane CLI, locate your warp route under the `/deployments/warp_routes` directory, and execute the following with `address` set to the `addressOrDenom` of your warp route:

```bash
hyperlane warp read --address 0x... --chain yourchain
```

After running `warp read`, confirm that the trusted relayer ISM has been removed from your warp route. You should see a similar config under `interchainSecurityModule`:

```yaml
yourchain:
  mailbox: "0x979Ca5202784112f4738403dBec5D0F3B9daabB9"
  owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  interchainSecurityModule:
    address: "0x8af9445d8A3FbFBd1D5dF185B8a4533Ab060Cf36"
    type: "staticAggregationIsm"
    modules:
      - owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
        address: "0xBe0232d5d45f9aD8322C2C4F84c39e64302Cd996"
        type: "defaultFallbackRoutingIsm"
        domains: {}
    threshold: 1
  name: "Ether"
  symbol: "ETH"
  decimals: 18
  totalSupply: 0
  type: "native"
```

By completing these steps, you've successfully removed the trusted relayer ISM from your Warp Route and enhanced the security of your warp route setup. Your warp route is now ready for production use.
