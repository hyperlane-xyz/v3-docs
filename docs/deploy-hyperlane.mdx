# How to Connect Your Chain with Hyperlane

:::info

- This guide will help you deploy Hyperlane to your new chain as quickly as possible for testing, not production. This includes the core mailbox and ISM contracts as well as warp route contracts for assets you’re bridging.
- To see which chains are already supported, visit the [Registry](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry/tree/main/chains).
- If you need any help, reach out on #developers on Discord or [get in touch](https://forms.gle/KyRTaWvo4XNmNvrq6).

:::

## Prerequisites

Anyone can begin this quickstart guide once they have the following artifacts & assets available:

- A new, custom, or pre-existing network of your choice, including the following metadata:
  - A chain name, e.g. `ethereum`
  - A chain ID, e.g. `1`
  - A RPC URL, e.g. `https://eth.llamarpc.com`
- A deployer wallet/EOA private key or seed phrase
  - This EOA should be funded on your custom chain and any chain you will be passing messages to & from
- [Hyperlane CLI](/docs/reference/cli.mdx)

## 1. Registry

Let’s create a custom chain config, run:

```bash
hyperlane registry init
```

Follow the prompts to set up your chain metadata. Setting up block or gas properties is optional.

Now, under `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains` you will find a new folder named with your custom chain’s name, and a file named `metadata.yaml` within that folder.

<details> 
  <summary>
    Example content of this config at `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains/yourchain/metadata.yaml`
  </summary>

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../schema.json
# Metadata for your custom chain

  - apiUrl: https://explorer.yourchain.com/api
    apiKey: XXXX # helpful to avoid rate limiting on the contract verification API
    family: etherscan #explorer you're using, also supporting routescan or blockscout

nativeToken:
  name: Ether
  symbol: ETH
  decimals: 18

rpcUrls:

```

</details>

## 2. Core

Next, let’s configure, deploy and test your custom chain’s core contracts.

### Initialize configuration

1. From your local environment, set the private key or seed phrase of your funded deployer address to `HYP_KEY`. For example: `export HYP_KEY='<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>'`
2. From the same terminal instance, run:

```bash
hyperlane core init
```

<details>
  <summary>
    The deployment config will be written to `./configs/core-config.yaml`
  </summary>

```yaml
# The address that owns and manages the deployed contracts. This account has admin privileges.
owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"

# The default Interchain Security Module (ISM) configuration.
defaultIsm:
  #`type`: Specifies the type of ISM. Here, it uses a trusted relayer ism.
  type: trustedRelayerIsm
  #`relayer`: The address of the relayer responsible for processing interchain messages.
  relayer: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"

defaultHook:
  # A hook configuration that specifies the use of a Merkle Tree.
  type: merkleTreeHook

requiredHook:
  # The owner address responsible for managing the hook configuration.
  owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
  # The type of hook. This one applies a protocol fee mechanism.
  type: protocolFee
  # The address that receives the protocol fees.
  beneficiary: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
  # The maximum fee allowed by the protocol, in wei.
  maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
  # The current fee charged by the protocol, set to 0 for testing purposes.
  protocolFee: "0"
```

</details>

### Deploy contracts

To deploy contracts, run:

```bash
hyperlane core deploy
```

Use the arrows and enter to select your custom chain from the bottom of the mainnet list. It will take a few minutes for all contracts to deploy.

<details>
  <summary>
    Under `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains` you will find a new folder named with your
    custom chain’s name, and a file named `addresses.yaml` within that folder
  </summary>

```yaml

:::warning

`getStorageAt()` Compatibility: Some chains may not utilize the `getStorageAt()` API. If your deployment encounters related issues, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](./deploy-hyperlane-troubleshooting#getstorageat-compatibility).

### Send test message

To send a test message, run:

```bash
hyperlane send message --relay
```

The `--relay` flag is optional and will deliver the message to the destination chain.

You can also run a relayer in the background with

```bash
hyperlane relayer --chains yourchain,sepolia
```

:::success
**🎉 Congrats! You have successfully sent a message to your custom chain**
:::

## 3. Warp Route

Now that you have a Hyperlane mailbox and core contracts on your chain, it’s time to set up token bridging between your chain and any other Hyperlane chain.

Continue on to the [Deploy a Warp Route](/docs/guides/deploy-warp-route.mdx) docs for more details.

## 4. Submit to Registry

If you want other chains to connect with you as well as to take this to production, make a registry PR.

### Ensure complete info

Make sure your metadata is complete:

- add a `logo.svg` file inside the folder
- include `Deployer` information identifying the team deploying
- indicate `isTestnet` `true` if the chain is testnet
- add the api url `gnosisSafeTransactionServiceUrl` if you have a gnosis safe service
- lint the yaml files and order alphabetically

### Commit to Github

First, navigate to your local instance of the registry and commit changes

```bash
cd ~/.hyperlane && git init && git add . && git commit
```

Then, sync local registry with canonical registry

```bash
git remote add canonical git@github.com:hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry.git
git pull canonical main --rebase
```

Finally, push local registry to github fork and submit a PR. Please include a [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) in your PR.

**Congrats! You have successfully deployed Hyperlane to your chain and added your work to the Hyperlane registry**

Thank you for contributing to the future of permissionless interop 🫡

### Take to Production

#### Community-Run Infra

As a public good, a core dev team for Hyperlane - Abacus Works - can help take your mainnet chain to production free of charge. Feel free to request this in your PR, new chain batches are added every two weeks.

This includes running a relayer connecting your chain to the network, adding your chain to the [Explorer](https://explorer.hyperlane.xyz/), and running one of the validators in your chain's default validator set. There is no ongoing cost or lock-in - at any time you can choose to migrate your relayer to a self-hosted option or change your validator set.

#### Self-Host Infra

Chains with devops experience, like Stride, choose to run their own relayer. While this does have some operations burden, this allows them to add new chains even faster at their pace. In addition, they can choose to set or subsidize the interchain gas costs related to relaying. See the [Operate](/docs/operate/relayer/run-relayer.mdx) docs for more information.
