# Get Started

Hyperlane can be deployed by anyone to any chain.
This guide covers sending your first interchain message from a new EVM chain. By the end of this guide you will have deployed and configured your Mailbox smart contract and off-chain agents, allowing developers to send interchain messages to and from your chain.

:::note

This guide has been specifically made to demonstrate how to connect a chain that _already has Hyperlane on it_ to a new chain that does _not_ have Hyperlane.

## Overview

There are five steps in this guide:

1. [<b>Set up keys</b>](#1-set-up-keys) that you will use to deploy contracts and run validators and relayers.
2. [<b>Deploy contracts</b>](#2-deploy-contracts) to the local chain and to every remote chain with which the local chain will be able to send and receive messages.
3. [<b>Run validators and relayers </b>](#3-run-validators-relayers) using [Kurtosis](https://cloud.kurtosis.com). Validators provide the signatures needed for the Interchain Security Modules you deployed in step 2 and relayers send and receive messages between chains you deployed contracts to in step 2.
4. [<b>Send a test message</b>](#4-send-test-messages) to confirm that your relayer is able to deliver messages to and from each pair of chains.
5. [<b>Deploy a Warp Route</b>](#5-optional-deploy-a-warp-route) to send token value, not just messages, across chains.

## Getting Started

## 2. Deploy contracts

## 3. Run validators and relayers

:::note

This section covers how to 1-click deploy agents using a third party. To run the Hyperlane agent binaries yourself, follow the [Local Agents guide](guides/deploy-hyperlane-local-agents.mdx).

:::

We've partnered with [Kurtosis](https://www.kurtosis.com/) to provide a single-click validator and relayer deployment in the cloud. You'll receive a one-month trial during which your validator and relayer run in Kurtosis Cloud for free. After your trial ends, you'll need to either run your validator and relayer yourself or purchase a Kurtosis Cloud subscription.

To get started, [install](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/) Kurtosis.

```bash
brew install kurtosis-tech/tap/kurtosis-cli
```

Then, use the `deploy kurtosis-agents` command to generate a link for configuring your Kurtosis deployment.

```bash
hyperlane deploy kurtosis-agents
```

Follow the prompts and then click on the Kurtosis Cloud link output by the command.

If this is your first time using Kurtosis Cloud, you'll need to sign in with Google and Kurtosis will provision a remote cloud instance for your validator and relayer in roughly 2 minutes.

A prefilled configuration screen will pop up with all your relayer and validator information from Steps 1 and 2.

:::note

If you are having issues deploying agents on Kurtosis Cloud through the CLI, you can manually enter this information by:

1. Signing into [Kurtosis Cloud](https://cloud.kurtosis.com/).
1. Clicking `Run` on the [Hyperlane Package](https://cloud.kurtosis.com/gateway/ips/18-206-3-164/ports/9711/catalog/github.com%2Fkurtosis-tech%2Fhyperlane-package).
1. Filling in the configuration modal.

:::

The last step will be to input your `Validator Key` from Step 2. The screenshots below show an example prefilled configuration.

:::warning

The Kurtosis team is still building the secrets functionality of Kurtosis Cloud, so for now do not enter any sensitive information (e.g. your private keys) into Kurtosis! Only testing and non-sensitive values should be used.

:::

![Example Configuration One](../static/img/kurtosis-example-config-one.png)

![Example Configuration Two](../static/img/kurtosis-example-config-two.png)

Click `Run` to deploy your relayer and validator!

Once the configuration finishes executing successfully, you'll see a green check mark. Congratulations! You've now deployed your own relayer and validator with Kurtosis!

![Success](../static/img/kurtosis-success.png)

You can see information about your relayer and validator deployment, including logs, by navigating to the `Overview` tab.

For issues with Kurtosis, please file an [issue on the Kurtosis Github repository](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis/issues/new/choose). For questions or discussion, use the [Github Discussions section of the Kurtosis repository](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis/discussions/new?category=q-a) or visit [the Kurtosis Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/jJFG7XBqcY).

:::info

Kurtosis offers a one-month free trial of Kurtosis Cloud for running your relayer and validator, but when your trial expires you'll need to add a payment method to continue running your Hyperlane deployment. View subscription prices [here](https://kurtosis.com/pricing) and payment method information [here](https://cloud.kurtosis.com/payment-method).
