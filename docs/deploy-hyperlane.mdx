# Deploy Hyperlane to a new chain

:::info
This guide will help you deploy Hyperlane to your new chain as quickly as possible for testing, not production. This includes the core mailbox and ISM contracts as well as warp route contracts for assets you’re bridging.

To see which chains are already supported, visit the [Registry](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry/tree/main/chains).
:::

## Prerequisites

Anyone can begin this quickstart guide once they have the following artifacts & assets available:
- A new, custom, or pre-existing network of your choice, including the following metadata:
    - A chain name, e.g. `ethereum`
    - A chain ID, e.g. `1`
    - A RPC URL, e.g. `https://eth.llamarpc.com`
- A deployer wallet/EOA private key or seed phrase
    - This EOA should be funded on your custom chain and any chain you will be passing messages to & from
- [Hyperlane CLI](/docs/reference/cli.mdx)

## 1) Registry

Let’s create a custom chain config, run:

```bash
hyperlane registry init
```

Follow the prompts to set up your chain metadata. Setting up block or gas properties is optional.

Now, under `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains` you will find a new folder named with your custom chain’s name, and a file named `metadata.yaml` within that folder.

<details> 
  <summary>
    Example content of this config at `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains/yourchain/metadata.yaml`
  </summary>

   ```yaml
    # yaml-language-server: $schema=../schema.json
    name: yourchain
    chainId: 171717
    domainId: 171717
    protocol: ethereum
    rpcUrls:
      - http: https://hyper-lane-docs.rpc.caldera.xyz/http
    nativeToken:
      name: Ether
      symbol: ETH
      decimals: 18
    ```
</details>

In addition to the CLI generated config above, you should also edit in the block explorer url.

```yaml
blockExplorers:
  - apiUrl: https://explorer.yourchain.com/api
    family: etherscan #explorer you're using, also supporting routescan or blockscout
    name: Chainscan
    url: https://explorer.yourchain.com
```

## 2) Core

Next, let’s configure, deploy and test your custom chain’s core contracts.

### Initialize configuration

1. From your local environment, set the private key or seed phrase of your funded deployer address to `HYP_KEY`. For example: `export HYP_KEY='<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>'`
2. From the same terminal instance, run:
    
  ```bash
  hyperlane core init
  ```
<details>
  <summary>
    The deployment config will be written to `./configs/core-config.yaml`
  </summary>
  
  ```yaml
  owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
  defaultIsm:
    type: trustedRelayerIsm
    relayer: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
  defaultHook:
    type: merkleTreeHook
  requiredHook:
    owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
    type: protocolFee
    beneficiary: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
    maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
    protocolFee: "0"
  ```
    
</details>


### Deploy contracts

To deploy contracts, run:

```bash
hyperlane core deploy
```

Use the arrows and enter to select your custom chain from the bottom of the mainnet list. 
It will take a few minutes for all contracts to deploy.
<details> 
  <summary>
    Under `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains` you will find a new folder named with your custom chain’s name, and a file named `addresses.yaml` within that folder
  </summary>
  ```yaml
    staticMerkleRootMultisigIsmFactory: "0x6906cb4741d3E2322E9f9aA645DfC8AB6F122c47"
    staticMessageIdMultisigIsmFactory: "0x3CE97a32d9C8294691cBd2baC09B078EDa75c429"
    staticAggregationIsmFactory: "0x81f969fDBF48278Ce09685Ce48e03388B6785aF4"

    testRecipient: "0xa58462b1943Be1469Ed58db690C78583BA34Fd2E"
    ```
</details>
    
### Send test message

To send a test message, run:

```bash
hyperlane send message --relay
```

Currently core self-relay only works **from Holesky** **to your custom chain**. When dispatch is successful, you should see that the message was self-relayed!

Support in the CLI for other origin chains is being added; chains that are not supported will output `Error: No fallback hook config found`.


:::note
**🎉 Congrats! You have successfully sent a message to your custom chain**

## 3) Warp Route

Now that you have a Hyperlane mailbox and core contracts on your chain, it’s time to set up token bridging between your chain and any other Hyperlane chain. 

Continue on to the [Deploy a Warp Route](/docs/guides/deploy-warp-route.mdx) docs for more details.

## 4) Submit to Registry

If you want other chains to connect with you as well as to take this to production with Abacus Works, make a registry PR. 

Before doing so, make sure you lint the yaml file as well as add a `logo.svg` file inside the folder.

First, navigate to your local instance of the registry and commit changes

```bash
cd ~/.hyperlane && git init && git add . && git commit
```

Then, sync local registry with canonical registry

```bash
git remote add canonical git@github.com:hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry.git
git pull canonical main --rebase
```

Finally, push local registry to github fork and submit a PR. Please include a [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) in your PR.

:::note
**Congrats! You have successfully deployed Hyperlane to your chain and added your work to the Hyperlane registry**

Thank you for contributing to the future of permissionless interop 🫡
