# Mailbox

:::caution

This protocol overview is from our v2 contract version.

v3 now includes [post-dispatch hooks](../reference/hooks/overview.mdx), with [interchain gas payments (IGP)](../reference/hooks/interchain-gas.mdx) as one of the required hooks.

We are working to update it with the relevant content ASAP. In the meantime, see the fully [**updated v3 Reference**](../reference/messaging/messaging-interface.mdx) tab for the latest contract interfaces.

The Hyperlane `Mailbox` smart contracts expose an on-chain API for sending and receiving interchain messages. There is a `Mailbox` contract deployed on every chain Hyperlane supports.

The network of `Mailboxes` facilitates the connective tissue between blockchains that developers leverage to create interchain applications, and add interchain functionality to their existing applications.

## Interface

The `IMailbox` interface exposes two state-mutating functions; `dispatch()` and `process()`, which are used to send and receive messages, respectively.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT OR Apache-2.0
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

interface IMailbox {
    function dispatch(
        uint32 _destinationDomain,
        bytes32 _recipientAddress,
        bytes calldata _messageBody
    ) external returns (bytes32);

    function process(bytes calldata _metadata, bytes calldata _message)
        external;
}
```

### Dispatch

To send interchain messages, developers call `Mailbox.dispatch()`.

This function takes as parameters the message contents, the destination chain ID, and the recipient address. Each message get inserted as a leaf into an [incremental merkle tree](https://medium.com/@josephdelong/ethereum-2-0-deposit-merkle-tree-13ec8404ca4f) stored by the `Mailbox`.

Hyperlane's proof of stake protocol uses this merkle tree to verify fraud proofs.

### Process

To deliver interchain messages, the [relayer](./agents/relayer.mdx) calls `Mailbox.process()`.

This function takes as parameters the message to deliver as well as arbitrary metadata that can be specified by the relayer.

The `Mailbox` will pass the message and metadata to the recipient's interchain security module for verification. If the ISM successfully verifies the message, the `Mailbox` delivers the message to the recipient by calling `recipient.handle()`.
