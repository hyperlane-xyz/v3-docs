# Mailbox

The Hyperlane `Mailbox` smart contracts expose an on-chain API for sending and receiving interchain messages. There is a `Mailbox` contract deployed on every chain Hyperlane supports.

The network of `Mailboxes` facilitates the connective tissue between blockchains that developers leverage to create interchain applications, and add interchain functionality to their existing applications.

<SimpleMessagingDiagram />

- To [**send**](../reference/messaging/send.mdx) interchain messages, call the `dispatch` function.
- To [**receive**](../reference/messaging/receive.mdx) interchain messages, implement the `handle` function.

## Interface

The [`IMailbox`](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/interfaces/IMailbox.sol) interface exposes two state-mutating functions; `dispatch()` and `process()`, which are used to send and receive messages, respectively.

### Message Headers

The Mailbox prepends message bodies with a header containing the following fields:

| **Field**     | **Description**                                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`     | The version of the Mailbox contract                            |
| `nonce`       | A unique identifier for each message sent from a given Mailbox |
| `origin`      | The domain of the origin chain                                 |
| `sender`      | The address of the sender on the origin chain                  |
| `destination` | The domain of the destination chain                            |
| `recipient`   | The address of the recipient on the destination chain          |

See the [`Message` library](../reference/libraries/message.mdx) for more information on the message encoding.

### Uniqueness

The `nonce` is a monotonically increasing integer for each message sent from a given Mailbox. It is incremented each time a message is dispatched to serve as a separator for otherwise identical messages.

```

The `messageId` is a globally unique message identifier, returned from the `dispatch` call, computed as the `keccak256` hash of the message (with headers).

### Replay Protection

The Mailbox maintains a mapping of already delivered `messageId` values to prevent replay attacks. If a message is received with a `messageId` that has already been delivered, the message is rejected.

## Dispatch

To send interchain messages, developers call `Mailbox.dispatch()`.

This function takes as parameters the message contents, the destination chain ID, and the recipient address. Each message get inserted as a leaf into an [incremental merkle tree](https://medium.com/@josephdelong/ethereum-2-0-deposit-merkle-tree-13ec8404ca4f) stored by the `Mailbox`.

Hyperlane's proof of stake protocol uses this merkle tree to verify fraud proofs.

## Process

To deliver interchain messages, the [relayer](./agents/relayer.mdx) calls `Mailbox.process()`.

This function takes as parameters the message to deliver as well as arbitrary metadata that can be specified by the relayer.

The `Mailbox` will pass the message and metadata to the recipient's interchain security module for verification. If the ISM successfully verifies the message, the `Mailbox` delivers the message to the recipient by calling `recipient.handle()`.
