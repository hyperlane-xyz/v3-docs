# Warp Routes: Fast Native Transfers via Custom Gas Tokens

This document will walk you through how to use Hyperlane to enable fast native transfers to and from your L2 via a custom gas token.

## Primary Motives

1. Create a custom gas token to use on your L2 of choice.
2. Use this gas token to enable fast native transfers, instead of long wait times for settlement via canonical bridges.

## Pre-Requisites

To complete the following case-study walkthrough, you should have the following available:

1. A L2 network (”yourchain”) on which you are able to specify a [custom gas token](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/how-tos/use-a-custom-gas-token) and would like to enable fast native transfers to and from.
2. A sole deployer or authorized owner to receive mint of the receipt token (more information on this token below).
3. An installed instance of the [Hyperlane CLI](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/cli) and a wallet private key sourced as `HYP_KEY`, funded on all networks in question.

## Walkthrough: Fast Native Transfers

Note that a “receipt token” below is a (one-time) mintable “dummy” token used to collateralize a warp-route on an L1 network of choice.

### Steps

1. Deploy a `rETH` receipt token to ethereum to represent ethereum’s native token (`rETH` will also become your L2’s custom gas token).
    1. For example, you may deploy your receipt token via [Remix](https://www.notion.so/Warp-Routes-Custom-Gas-Tokens-Fast-Native-Transfers-v1-e984996a93be4458906b5ed565ee87b8?pvs=21) with a funded wallet and a contract similar to below:

        ```solidity
        // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
        pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

        import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

        contract ReceiptETH is ERC20 {
            constructor() ERC20("ReceiptETH", "rETH") {
                _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * (10 ** 18));
            }
        }
        ```

    2. Ensure 100% of the total supply of your `rETH` receipt token is minted to the deployer or authorized address of choice. This must be a one-time mint event in order to avoid value dilution of the ethereum ↔ yourchain native warp route, below.
    3. Once deployed, save the address of the contract for use below.
2. Set the custom gas token on yourchain to the newly deployed `rETH` ERC20.
    1. To set a custom gas token on arbitrum orbit: https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/how-tos/use-a-custom-gas-token
3. Using the Hyperlane CLI, deploy an ethereum `rETH` EvmHypCollateral ↔ yourchain `ETH` EvmHypNative warp route:
    1. Run `hyperlane warp init` and complete the following flow:
        1. Select `ethereum` and `yourchain` using space, and hit enter.
        2. For ethereum, select `collateral`, accept the mailbox, and enter the newly deployed `rETH` address, from above.
        3. For yourchain, select `native` and accept the mailbox.
    2. Run `hyperlane warp deploy` and confirm the warp deploy config is as expected.
    3. Use the warp route to transfer 100% of the `rETH` receipt token from ethereum to yourchain.
4. Using the Hyperlane CLI, deploy an ethereum `ETH` EvmHypNative ↔ yourchain `ETH` EvmHypNative warp route:
    1. Run `hyperlane warp init` and complete the following flow:
        1. Select `ethereum` and `yourchain` using space, and hit enter.
        2. For ethereum, select `native` and accept the mailbox.
        3. For yourchain, select `native` and accept the mailbox.
    2. Run `hyperlane warp deploy` and confirm the warp deploy config is as expected.
5. Deposit yourchain `ETH` as collateral in yourchain’s native warp route. This collateralizes the native warp route, enabling users to bridge their native assets quickly to and from yourchain.

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    		box ethereum L1
    			participant ETH as ETH (Native)
    	    participant rETH_C as rETH (Collateral)
        end
    		box yourchain L2
    	    participant yETH_N as ETH (Native)
        end

        rETH_C-->>yETH_N: 1) transfer 100%<br>of receipt token
        Note over yETH_N: 2) set custom gas<br>token to rETH
        yETH_N-->>yETH_N: 3) deposit native<br>as collateral
        yETH_N-->ETH: <- fast ETH transfer ->
    ```


**🎉 Congrats! You have now enabled fast native transfer to and from yourchain via a custom gas token on your L2.**

:::warning
Please note that this collateralization strategy takes on certain ISM trust assumptions.
