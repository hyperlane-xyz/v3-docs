# Warp Routes: Fast Native Transfers via Custom Gas Tokens

This document will walk you through how to use Hyperlane to enable fast native transfers to and from your L2 via a custom gas token.

# Primary Motives

1. Create a custom gas token to use on your L2 of choice.
2. Use this gas token to enable fast native transfers, instead of long wait times for settlement via canonical bridges.

# Pre-Requisites

To complete the following case-study walkthrough, you should have the following available:

1. A L2 network (‚Äùyourchain‚Äù) on which you are able to specify a [custom gas token](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/how-tos/use-a-custom-gas-token) and would like to enable fast native transfers to and from.
2. A sole deployer or authorized owner to receive mint of the receipt token (more information on this token below).
3. An installed instance of the [Hyperlane CLI](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/cli) and a wallet private key sourced as `HYP_KEY`, funded on all relevant networks.

## Steps

### 1) Deploy a Receipt Token

Deploy a `rETH` receipt token to ethereum to represent ethereum's native token (`rETH` will also become your L2's custom gas token).

1. For example, you may deploy your receipt token via [Remix](https://www.notion.so/Warp-Routes-Custom-Gas-Tokens-Fast-Native-Transfers-v1-e984996a93be4458906b5ed565ee87b8?pvs=21) with a funded wallet and a contract similar to below:

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

    contract ReceiptETH is ERC20 {
        constructor() ERC20("ReceiptETH", "rETH") {
            _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * (10 ** 18));
        }
    }
    ```

2. Ensure 100% of the total supply of your `rETH` receipt token is minted to the deployer or authorized address of choice. This must be a one-time mint event in order to avoid value dilution of the ethereum ‚Üî yourchain native warp route, below.
3. Once deployed, save the address of the new token for use below.

### 2) Set the Custom Gas Token

Set the custom gas token on yourchain to the newly deployed `rETH` ERC20.

### 3) Deploy a Native Warp Route

Using the Hyperlane CLI, deploy an ethereum `ETH` EvmHypNative ‚Üî yourchain `ETH` EvmHypNative warp route.

1. Run `hyperlane warp init` and complete the following flow:
    1. Select `ethereum` and `yourchain` using space, and hit enter.
    2. For ethereum, select `native` and accept the mailbox.
    3. For yourchain, select `native` and accept the mailbox.
2. Run `hyperlane warp deploy` and confirm the warp deploy config is as expected.

### 4) Transfer All Receipt Tokens

Use the warp route to transfer 100% of the `rETH` receipt token from ethereum to yourchain.

### 5) Collateralize Your Warp Route

Deposit yourchain `ETH` as collateral in yourchain's native warp route. This collateralizes the native warp route, enabling users to bridge their native assets quickly to and from yourchain.

**üéâ Congrats! You have now enabled fast native transfer to and from yourchain via a custom gas token on your L2.**

sequenceDiagram
		box ethereum L1
	    participant rETH as rETH (ERC20)
			participant ETH as ETH (Native)
    end
		box yourchain L2
	    participant yETH as ETH (Native)
    end

    Note over yETH: 1) set custom gas<br>token to rETH
    rETH-->>yETH: 2) transfer 100%<br>of receipt token
    yETH-->>yETH: 3) deposit native<br>as collateral
    yETH-->ETH: <- fast ETH transfer ->
```

:::warning
Please note that this collateralization strategy takes on certain ISM trust assumptions.
