# Wormhole ISM

:::warning
`WormholeISM` is coming soon and is not yet implemented. This page is shown for informational purposes only. Details may change as the design matures.
:::

The `WormholeISM` encodes the security model used by [Wormhole's](https://wormhole.com/) interchain communication protocol.

This ISM requires that 13 of the 19 [Wormhole guardians](https://wormhole.com/network/#guardians) attest to the validity of a Hyperlane message.

## Compose

Developers can compose a Wormhole ISM with a [Multisig ISM](multisig-ISM.mdx) using an [Aggregation ISM](aggregation-ISM.mdx) to require that m of n Hyperlane validators **and** 13-of-19 Wormhole guardians verify a message.
