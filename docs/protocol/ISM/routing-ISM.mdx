# Routing ISM

Developers can use a `RoutingISM` to delegate message verification to a different ISM. This allows developers to change security models based on message content or application context.

This ISM simply switches security models depending on the origin chain of the message. A simple use case for this is to use different [Multisig ISM](multisig-ISM.mdx) validator sets for each chain.

Eventually, you could imagine a `DomainRoutingIsm` routing to different light-client-based ISMs, depending on the type of consensus protocol used on the origin chain.

## Customize

The hyperlane-monorepo contains an abstract `RoutingISM` implementation that application developers can fork.

Developers simply need to implement the `route()` function.

By creating a custom implementation, application developers can tailor the security provided by a `RoutingISM` to the needs of their application.

For example, a custom implementation could change security models based on the contents of the message or the state of the application receiving the message.
