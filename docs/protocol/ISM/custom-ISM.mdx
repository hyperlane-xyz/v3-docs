# Creating Your Own ISM

Developers can specify or override the default ISM by implementing the `ISpecifiesInterchainSecurityModule` interface in their application.

:::info
If no ISM is specified, or if the specified ISM is the null address, the default ISM configured on the destination chain's Mailbox will be used.
:::

## ISM Interface

ISMs must implement the `IInterchainSecurityModule` interface. This implementation can be configured, composed, and customized according to the needs of their application.

Specifically, this interface must be implemented in the same smart contract that implements `handle()`.

The interface consists of two functions: `verify` and `moduleType`.

### Verify

```solidity file=<rootDir>/node_modules/@hyperlane-xyz/core/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainSecurityModule.sol#L27-L38

```

The primary function that ISMs must implement is `verify()`. The [Mailbox](../mailbox.mdx) will call `IInterchainSecurityModule.verify()` before delivering a message to its recipient. If `verify()` reverts or returns `false`, the message will not be delivered.

#### Parameters:

- `_metadata`: consists of arbitrary bytes provided by the [Relayer](../agents/relayer.mdx). Typically, these bytes are specific to the ISM. For example, the `_metadata` for a [Multisig ISM](multisig-ISM.mdx) must include validator signatures.

- `_message`: consists of the Hyperlane message being verified. ISMs can use this to inspect details about the message being verified. For example, a [Multisig ISM](multisig-ISM.mdx) could change validator sets based on the origin chain of the message.

:::warning
See the [`Message.sol`](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/libs/Message.sol) library for more information on the format of the Hyperlane message passed to `verify()`.
:::

### Module type

The secondary function that ISMs must implement is `moduleType()`.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/node_modules/@hyperlane-xyz/core/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainSecurityModule.sol#L20-L25

```

This is used to signal to the [Relayer](../agents/relayer.mdx) what to include in `_metadata`. ISMs **must** return one of the supported module types.

```solidity file=<rootDir>/node_modules/@hyperlane-xyz/core/contracts/interfaces/IInterchainSecurityModule.sol#L5-L18

```

:::info

- All ISM contracts must implement the ISM interface, which requires `moduleType` to be defined.
  This type is branched on by the Relayer in order to determine the required metadata for that ISM.
  For more information on module types and their metadata formats, see [Protocol](/docs/protocol/ISM/modular-security.mdx#module-type).

- For more information on the available module types and their respective metadata, please visit the ISM docs outlined in this section, e.g. [Multisig ISM](./multisig-ISM.mdx).
