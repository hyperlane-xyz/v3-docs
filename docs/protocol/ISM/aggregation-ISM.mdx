# Aggregation ISM

Developers can use an `AggregationISM` to combine security from multiple ISMs. Simply put, an `AggregationISM` requires that `m` of `n` ISMs verify a particular interchain message.

Developers can configure, for each origin chain, a set of `n` ISMs, and the number of ISMs needed to verify a message.

`AggregationISMs` can aggregate the security of any ISMs. For example, users can deploy a [Multisig ISM](multisig-ISM.mdx) with their own validator set, and deploy an `AggregationISM` that aggregates that ISM with the Hyperlane default ISM.

## Customize

The hyperlane-monorepo contains an abstract `AggregationISM` implementation that application developers can fork.

Developers simply need to implement the `modulesAndThreshold()` function.

By creating a custom implementation, application developers can tailor the security provided by a `AggregationISM` to the needs of their application.

For example, a custom implementation could require that low value messages be verified by a [Multisig ISM](multisig-ISM.mdx), and require that high value messages _also_ be verified by a [Wormhole ISM](./wormhole-ISM.mdx).
