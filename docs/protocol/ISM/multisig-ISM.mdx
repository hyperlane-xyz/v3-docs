# Multisig ISM

The `MultisigISM` is one of the most commonly used ISM types. These ISMs verify that `m` of `n` [Validators](../agents/validators.mdx) have attested to the validity of a particular interchain message.

## Multisig Module Types

Based on the following module types, the relayer will encode the appropriately formatted metadata:

```solidity
enum Types {
    ...
    MERKLE_ROOT_MULTISIG,
    MESSAGE_ID_MULTISIG,
    ...
}
```

For the aforementioned module Types, the following metadata formats are satisfied by the relayer for use by the ISMs:

### MessageIdMultisigIsmMetadata

```solidity
Format of metadata:
[   0:  32] Origin merkle tree address
[  32:  64] Signed checkpoint root
[  64:  68] Signed checkpoint index
[  68:????] Validator signatures (length := threshold * 65)
```

### MerkleRootMultisigIsmMetadata

```solidity
Format of metadata:
[   0:  32] Origin merkle tree address
[  32:  36] Index of message ID in merkle tree
[  36:  68] Signed checkpoint message ID
[  68:1092] Merkle proof
[1092:1096] Signed checkpoint index (computed from proof and index)
[1096:????] Validator signatures (length := threshold * 65)
```
