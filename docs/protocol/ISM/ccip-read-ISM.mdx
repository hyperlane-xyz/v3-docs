# CCIP Read ISM

Using a `CcipReadIsm` provides developers with a lot of flexibility for verifying interchain messages. Ultimately, every other kind of ISM can be implemented as a CCIP Read ISM, so when building new types of ISM's moving forward it's encouraged to build CCIP Read ISM's as all the relayer integration work has already been done.

One caveat to keep in mind for CCIP Read ISM's is that they do introduce a dependency on an external (to the blockchain), but self hostable, API. If this is a hard blocker for your use case, you may want to consider other message verification techniques.

Before building a CCIP Read ISM it's worth familiarizing yourself with the [CCIP Read specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668). The specification describes a generalized protocol that allows smart contracts on EVM compatible chains to query and consume offchain data.

## How it works

A relayer will constantly listening to `Dispatch` events emitted from Hyperlane [Mailboxes](../../protocol/mailbox.mdx). When a message is sent and picked up by a relayer, the relayer will query the destination ISM for information on how to process the message and if delivery will be successful.

:::info
The correct `moduleType` variable will need to be set on your ISM so that the relayer knows it's a CCIP Read ISM. To make sure this is configured correctly, you can inherit from the `AbstractCcipReadIsm` in `@hyperlane-xyz/core`.
:::

The relayer will then call the `getOffchainVerifyInfo(bytes)` function on the ISM with the contents of the message being delivered. This function should revert with the `OffchainLookup` error described in the [interface](#interface) section below.

The relayer will query the endpoint specified in this revert message and pass the provided response and original message to the `process(bytes,bytes)` function of the destination `Mailbox`.

## Interface

`CcipReadIsm`'s must implement the `ICcipReadIsm` interface and should extend the `AbstractCcipReadIsm`, a convenience contract that sets the `moduleType` correctly.

interface ICcipReadIsm is IInterchainSecurityModule {
    /// @dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668

     * @param _message data that will help construct the offchain query
     */
    function getOffchainVerifyInfo(bytes calldata _message) external view;
}
```

## Configure

A great example for reference while developing CCIP Read ISM's exists as the [ChainlinkISM](https://github.com/AlexBHarley/permissionless-chainlink-feeds). The `ChainlinkISM` is initialized with a set of Chainlink oracles and verifies the price feed data provided has been signed over by some subset of the signers.

### API

As per CCIP Read, the offchain API will need to return JSON data with the form,

```json
{
  "data": "..."
}
```

The relayer will pass this `data` property as the `metadata` parameter to `Mailbox.process(bytes metadata, bytes message)`.

Note that in the case of the Chainlink ISM, where the receiver of the data also acts as the verifying ISM, `data` is just the raw transaction sent to submit price feed data with associated signatures. The `message` property is somewhat redundant.

### Contract

When setting up the ISM, the `getOffchainVerifyInfo` and `verify` functions are the important ones to specify.

- `getOffchainVerifyInfo` function should revert with an `OffchainLookup` error that instructs the relayer to query the given API endpoint. The `OffchainLookup` error allows for an array of API endpoints to be provided, so you can enforce any level of redundancy you'd like

- `verify` must take the provided `metadata` and assert its legitimacy. Again the [ChainlinkISM implementation](https://github.com/AlexBHarley/permissionless-chainlink-feeds/blob/main/apps/contracts/contracts/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L114) can be a useful reference point when developing this logic for your own ISM.

Below is the scaffold of what a CCIP Read ISM could look like, where the ISM is also the receiver of the message, as per the Chainlink ISM.

```solidity

    function handle(uint32, bytes32, bytes calldata _report) public {}


    /**

     */
    function verify(
        bytes calldata _metadata,
        bytes calldata _message
    ) external returns (bool) {
        ...
    }

    function interchainSecurityModule()
        external
        view
        returns (IInterchainSecurityModule)
    {
        return IInterchainSecurityModule(address(this));
    }

    function getOffchainVerifyInfo(
        bytes calldata _message
    ) external view override {
        revert OffchainLookup(
            address(this),
            offchainUrls,
            _message,
            MyCcipReadIsm.process.selector,
            _message
        );
    }

    /**
     * Provided for full CCIP Read specification compatibility. Relayers
     * will call the Mailbox directly regardless of the selector specified
     * in the `OffchainLookup` error
     */
    function process(
        bytes calldata _metadata,
        bytes calldata _message
    ) external {
        mailbox.process(_metadata, _message);
    }
