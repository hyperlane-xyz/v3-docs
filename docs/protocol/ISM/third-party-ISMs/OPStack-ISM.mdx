# OP Stack ISM

The OP Stack ISM is used along with the OP Stack hook to leverage the security of OP Stack rollup's [settlement layer](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/understand/landscape/#execution) for messages passed between Ethereum and the rollup. See the [OP Stack Hook](/docs/reference/hooks/op-stack.mdx) for more information.
