# Optimistic ISM

Prioritizing safety over liveness

:::warning
`OptimisticISM` is coming soon and is not yet implemented. This page is shown for informational purposes only. Details may change as the design matures.

The `OptimisticISM` encodes the optimistic verification security model pioneered by [Optics](https://docs.celo.org/protocol/bridge/optics) and adopted by [Synapse](https://docs.synapseprotocol.com/docs/RFQ/Security/#proofs), [Nomad](https://docs.nomad.xyz/the-nomad-protocol/verification-mechanisms/optimistic-verification), and [Connext](https://blog.connext.network/optimistic-bridges-fb800dc7b0e0).

`OptimisticISMs` rely on a fraud window after message verification, during which `m` of `n` **watchers** configured on the `OptimisticISM` have an opportunity to flag messages as fraudulent, preventing them from being delivered to their recipient.

**This security model prioritizes safety over liveness;** the increased message latency allows for the addition of a second layer of security, the watchers, without significant increases in gas costs.
