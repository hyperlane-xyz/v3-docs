# Polygon PoS ISM

The Polygon PoS ISM is used along with the Polygon PoS hook to leverage the security of the Polygon [state sync mechanism](https://docs.polygon.technology/pos/architecture/bor/state-sync/) for messages passed between Ethereum and Polygon PoS chain. See the [Polygon PoS Hook](/docs/reference/hooks/polygon-pos.mdx) for more information.
