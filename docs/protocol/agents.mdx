# Agents

The Hyperlane protocol relies on decentralize offchain agents to observe, sign, and transmit messages. Keeping to the protocol's permissionless design, anyone can participate in operating & securing the protocol.

For convenience, Hyperlane implements these agents as a set of Rust binaries.

1. [Validators](/docs/protocol/agents/validators) attest to the validity of [Mailbox](/docs/protocol/mailbox) messages and make their signatures available to relayers.
1. [Relayers](/docs/protocol/agents/relayers) aggregate off-chain metadata for the [`IInterchainSecurityModule` interface](/docs/reference/ISM/specify-your-ISM) and deliver messages to their recipients.
1. [Watchtowers](/docs/protocol/agents/watchtowers) observe the network for fraud by validators. If detected, watchtowers submit evidence to the origin chain, slashing the fraudulent validator(s).
